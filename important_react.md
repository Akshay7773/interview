## Q.1 what is indexed db ? 
Great question! 👇

### 🗄️ What is **IndexedDB**?

**IndexedDB** is a **built-in database** in the browser that lets you store **large amounts of structured data** — including files or blobs — **directly on the client side** (inside the user’s browser).

It’s basically a **NoSQL database** (object store) that runs **in the browser**, allowing offline storage and complex querying.

---

### 💡 Key points:

| Concept              | Description                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**             | NoSQL, key–value based database                                     |
| **Storage location** | Inside the browser (persistent storage)                             |
| **Data size limit**  | Much larger than `localStorage` (can store hundreds of MBs or more) |
| **Asynchronous**     | Works with asynchronous APIs (Promises / callbacks)                 |
| **Structured data**  | Can store JavaScript objects, not just strings                      |
| **Indexed**          | You can create **indexes** for fast lookups on object fields        |

---

### 🧠 Example use cases:

* Offline web apps (e.g. note-taking apps, PWAs)
* Storing cached API responses
* Storing images or files locally
* Client-side search and filtering on large datasets

---

### 🧩 Comparison with `localStorage`

| Feature    | IndexedDB                        | localStorage           |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Data type  | Objects, arrays, blobs           | Strings only           |
| Size limit | Much larger (hundreds of MBs)    | ~5–10 MB               |
| API style  | Asynchronous (Promise or events) | Synchronous            |
| Speed      | Faster for large/complex data    | Simpler for small data |
| Indexing   | Supports indexes for queries     | No indexing            |

---

### ⚙️ Basic Example

```js
// Open (or create) a database
let request = indexedDB.open('MyDatabase', 1);

request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
  let db = event.target.result;

  // Create an object store
  let store = db.createObjectStore('users', { keyPath: 'id' });
  store.createIndex('name', 'name', { unique: false });
};

request.onsuccess = function(event) {
  let db = event.target.result;

  // Start a transaction
  let tx = db.transaction('users', 'readwrite');
  let store = tx.objectStore('users');

  // Add some data
  store.add({ id: 1, name: 'Alice' });
  store.add({ id: 2, name: 'Bob' });

  tx.oncomplete = () => console.log('All data added!');
};
```

## Q.2 explain cookies, localstorage, sessionStorage and differences between them ?
Perfect question 👍 — this is one of the most common and **important** topics in web development interviews and real-world JavaScript usage.

Let’s break it down clearly and compare **Cookies**, **localStorage**, and **sessionStorage** 👇

---

## 🍪 1️⃣ **Cookies**

**Cookies** are small pieces of data stored in the browser and **sent to the server with every HTTP request**.

### ✅ Key points:

* Used mainly for **server–client communication** (e.g. authentication, sessions).
* Automatically included in **HTTP headers**.
* Size limit: about **4KB** per cookie.
* Can have an **expiration date** (persistent) or expire when the browser closes (session cookie).
* Can be **secure**, **HttpOnly**, or **SameSite** (for security and privacy).

### 🧩 Example:

```js
// Set cookie
document.cookie = "username=Alice; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2025 23:59:59 GMT; path=/";

// Read cookies
console.log(document.cookie); // "username=Alice"

// Delete cookie (set expiry to past date)
document.cookie = "username=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT";
```

---

## 💾 2️⃣ **localStorage**

**localStorage** is a simple key–value storage in the browser.
It stores data **permanently** (until the user clears it manually or via code).

### ✅ Key points:

* Data **persists even after the browser is closed**.
* **Not sent to the server** automatically.
* Stores only **strings**.
* Size limit: around **5–10 MB** (depending on browser).
* Synchronous API (may block UI if misused with large data).

### 🧩 Example:

```js
// Store data
localStorage.setItem("username", "Alice");

// Get data
console.log(localStorage.getItem("username")); // "Alice"

// Delete one key
localStorage.removeItem("username");

// Clear all data
localStorage.clear();
```

---

## 🕐 3️⃣ **sessionStorage**

**sessionStorage** is almost the same as localStorage —
but it lasts **only for the duration of the tab/session**.

### ✅ Key points:

* Data is cleared when the **tab or browser is closed**.
* Separate for each **browser tab**.
* Not shared across tabs or windows.
* Not sent to the server.
* Same API as localStorage.

### 🧩 Example:

```js
// Store data for current tab
sessionStorage.setItem("theme", "dark");

// Get data
console.log(sessionStorage.getItem("theme")); // "dark"

// Data disappears when tab closes
```

## ⚖️ 🔍 **Comparison Table**

| Feature                 | **Cookies**                      | **localStorage**                     | **sessionStorage**             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Storage size**        | ~4KB                             | ~5–10MB                              | ~5MB                           |
| **Data lifetime**       | Depends on `expires`             | Until manually cleared               | Until tab is closed            |
| **Sent to server?**     | ✅ Yes (in HTTP headers)          | ❌ No                                 | ❌ No                           |
| **Accessible from JS?** | ✅ Yes (unless `HttpOnly`)        | ✅ Yes                                | ✅ Yes                          |
| **Storage type**        | Key–value pairs (string only)    | Key–value pairs (string only)        | Key–value pairs (string only)  |
| **Scope**               | Domain + path                    | Origin (domain + protocol + port)    | Tab + origin                   |
| **Use cases**           | Authentication, session tracking | Persistent user preferences, caching | Temporary data, one-time forms |

---

## 💡 When to Use What

| Use Case                               | Best Option                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Remember user login info across visits | `localStorage` or `cookie (with JWT)` |
| Temporary form data (until tab closed) | `sessionStorage`                      |
| Server-side session tracking           | `cookies`                             |
| Large client-side data (offline)       | `IndexedDB` (not localStorage)        |

---

### ⚠️ Security Notes:

* Don’t store **sensitive info (like passwords or tokens)** in `localStorage` — it’s accessible via JavaScript (XSS risk).
* Use **HttpOnly + Secure cookies** for sensitive authentication data.

## Q.3 can you tell me what is the latest react version and which are the stable once, and difference between current version and previous versions 

Here’s a breakdown of the latest version of React, which versions are considered stable, and what the key differences are compared to previous major versions.

---

## ✅ Latest & Stable Versions

* The latest stable major version is **React 19**, with version **19.2.0** released on Oct 1, 2025. ([VersionLog][1])
* The previous major version was **React 18**, first released March 29, 2022. ([VersionLog][2])
* React follows [semantic versioning](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/faq-versioning.html) (“semver”), so major version bumps may include breaking changes, while minor/patch versions are backwards-compatible. ([legacy.reactjs.org][3])
* According to support status, React 19 is in active support; React 18 is now flagged as “ended” for active support for new features (but still receives security fixes) per EOL listings. ([endoflife.date][4])

---

## 🆕 What’s New in React 19 vs React 18

Here’s a summary of the main new features / changes introduced in React 19 compared to React 18 (and earlier).

### Key additions in React 19

* React 19 introduces enhanced features around server components, streaming SSR, new hooks/APIs such as `useEffectEvent`, `use()`, and improved handling of async data and events. ([brilworks.com][5])
* Performance improvements: Better batching, improved compiler/renderer optimisations, prioritisation for UI updates (for example features like “Activity” component mentioned in community articles) in React 19. ([blog.radialcode.com][6])
* Better developer experience: More built-in support for forms (“Form Actions”), async flows, simpler APIs for event handling, less boilerplate for common patterns. ([brilworks.com][5])

### What React 18 introduced (so you can compare)

* React 18 introduced the new root API (`createRoot` vs `ReactDOM.render`), automatic batching of updates, transitions (`startTransition`) and Suspense improvements including server-side streaming support. ([YouTube][7])
* The shift in React 18 was more about enabling concurrent rendering patterns and preparing for larger async workflows.

### Differences in a nutshell

* **Breaking vs non-breaking**: React 19 continues to emphasise backwards compatibility; many apps built with React 18 will upgrade without major rewrites. But React 19 does add new APIs and capabilities (so some refactoring may be beneficial).
* **Focus shift**: React 18 focused on enabling concurrency and foundational changes; React 19 builds on that infrastructure and adds more features for developer ergonomics and performance.
* **Upgrade benefit**: If you upgrade from 18 → 19 you gain access to the latest APIs, reduced boilerplate, improved SSR/streaming, better async/event hooks. If you remain on 18 you still have a robust, stable platform—but you may miss out on newer patterns.
* **Ecosystem stability**: Since React 19 is stable and supported, for new projects it’s a strong candidate; for existing large codebases, migrating after testing is advisable.

---

## 🔍 Which Versions Are Stable / Should Use

* If you’re **starting a new project**, using React 19 is wise—you're getting the most recent major version with full support.
* If you have an existing app on React 18 and it’s working well, staying on 18 is still okay; but plan to upgrade to 19 when you can to benefit from new features and longer support lifecycle.
* Avoid staying on very old major versions (e.g., React 17 or earlier) unless you have a specific constraint—those versions may no longer receive full support and may block using new ecosystem features.

## Q.4 Differences between React 18 and React 19 ? 
Here’s a detailed breakdown of the key **differences between React 18 and React 19**, including what changed, what improved, and what you should watch out for — useful if you’re considering upgrading or just want to understand what’s new.

---

## ✅ What React 18 Brought

Before comparing with React 19, it’s helpful to recall the major features of React 18:

* Automatic batching of state updates (so multiple updates inside an event get batched to a single render) ([Medium][1])
* New root API: `createRoot` from `react-dom/client`, enabling concurrent features.
* Concurrent rendering / transitions (`startTransition`) and improved `Suspense` support (e.g., for data fetching) ([Medium][1])
* Better support for server-side rendering (SSR) streaming, though the server components story was still experimental.
* Improvements in developer tooling and hooks (e.g., `useId`, `useSyncExternalStore`, etc).

Thus, React 18 laid the foundation for more responsive UI, improved performance and async capabilities.

---

## 🚀 What’s New / Improved in React 19

React 19 builds on React 18’s foundation — it doesn’t completely rewrite everything, but introduces meaningful new APIs, performance improvements, and more stable features. Here are the notable changes:

### 1. **New `use()` API**

React 19 introduces a new hook `use()` (in addition to the classic hooks) that lets you read “resources” such as Promises or contexts directly in render. ([react.dev][2])
**Why it matters:**

* Simplifies async data usage: instead of manually wiring in `useEffect`, `then`, `await`, etc, you can use `use(promise)` inside a component (within a `Suspense` boundary) and React will handle the suspension. ([react.dev][2])
* Makes certain code paths cleaner and more declarative.

### 2. **Stabilised Server Components & SSR Improvements**

In React 18, server components (RSC) and related streaming hydration were still somewhat experimental. In React 19 they become much more production-ready. ([blog.radialcode.com][3])
Examples of improvements:

* Better integration of server-rendered components with smaller client bundles.
* Improved hydration (fewer mismatches, better error reporting) and streaming support for server rendering. ([infinity-group.pl][4])
* New APIs like `react-dom/static` → `prerender`, `prerenderToNodeStream` for static generation in streaming environments. ([react.dev][2])

### 3. **Less Boilerplate, Smarter Defaults (React Compiler, etc)**

React 19 introduces more “under the hood” optimisations: a React Compiler (in progress or experimental), automatic optimizations, extended automatic batching, and reduced need for manual performance-hacks (like `useMemo`, `useCallback`) in many cases. ([DEV Community][5])
**Highlights:**

* Automatic batching extended to more asynchronous cases (timeouts, promises) in React 19. ([nichetechsolutions.com][6])
* The “React Compiler” idea: transform become more performant, less manual optimisation needed. ([BlueBash portfolio][7])
* Simpler ref usage: e.g., allowing refs as props more cleanly, reducing need for `forwardRef`. ([kellton.com][8])

### 4. **New Hooks & APIs for Forms, Optimistic UI, Context**

React 19 adds several new built-in hooks and APIs:

* `useOptimistic` (for optimistic UI updates) ([GeeksforGeeks][9])
* `useFormStatus`, etc, to simplify form state handling ([GeeksforGeeks][9])
* Better async safe context and usage of `use` with contexts. ([DEV Community][10])
  These make common patterns (forms, optimistic updates, async data) less boilerplate heavy.

### 5. **Improved Hydration, Asset Loading, Metadata & Developer UX**

React 19 also improves in many smaller but meaningful ways:

* Better hydration error reporting (less cryptic mismatch errors) ([kellton.com][8])
* Better support for document metadata (`<title>`, `<meta>`) inside components without needing third-party libraries. ([vairix.com][11])
* Smarter asset loading (fonts, scripts, styles) and resource preloading earlier in the render process. ([DEV Community][5])

---

## ⚠️ What to Be Aware Of / Migration Considerations

When upgrading from React 18 → React 19 (or starting a new project), you should keep in mind:

* Although many changes are backwards-compatible, some features may require updates (especially if you use custom renderers or libraries built around React’s internal behaviour).
* Some new APIs (React Compiler, etc) may still be experimental or require opt‐in.
* Ecosystem libraries (third-party components) may lag in full compatibility with React 19 features (especially around server components or new hooks) — check dependencies.
* With new defaults (e.g., automatic batching, new ref behaviour) old code patterns might behave slightly differently — test thoroughly.
* When using SSR / server components, ensure your tooling/framework (e.g., Next.js, Remix) supports the React 19 features you plan to use.

## Q.5  New hooks added in React 19
Excellent 👏 — yes, **React 19** introduces several **new hooks** (and improves some existing patterns) that make async operations, form handling, and optimistic updates much simpler.

Let’s go through them clearly 👇

---

## 🧩 🆕 **New & Updated Hooks in React 19**

### 1️⃣ `use()` — Async data + context hook

**Purpose:** Simplifies working with Promises and Context inside components.

```jsx
function UserProfile({ userPromise }) {
  const user = use(userPromise); // Suspends while promise resolves
  return <h2>{user.name}</h2>;
}
```

✅ **What it does:**

* Lets you read async values (like a Promise) directly inside components.
* React automatically suspends rendering until the promise resolves (within a `<Suspense>` boundary).
* Can also be used to read context values inside async components:

  ```js
  const theme = use(ThemeContext);
  ```

✅ **Replaces**: manual `useEffect` + state logic for loading async data.

---

### 2️⃣ `useOptimistic()` — Optimistic UI updates

**Purpose:** Allows showing **temporary optimistic state** before the actual update completes (common in network-based actions).

```jsx
function AddComment() {
  const [comments, setComments] = useState([]);
  const [optimisticComments, addOptimisticComment] = useOptimistic(comments);

  async function handleAdd(newComment) {
    addOptimisticComment([...optimisticComments, newComment]);
    await sendToServer(newComment);
    setComments([...comments, newComment]);
  }

  return optimisticComments.map(c => <p>{c.text}</p>);
}
```

✅ **Why it’s useful:**

* Gives instant UI feedback (no waiting for server).
* Automatically rolls back if the server update fails.
* Great for forms, likes, messages, etc.

---

### 3️⃣ `useFormStatus()` — Track form submission state

**Purpose:** Works with `<form>` actions to check whether a form is currently submitting (integrates well with server actions).

```jsx
function SubmitButton() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();
  return <button disabled={pending}>{pending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}</button>;
}
```

✅ **Why it’s useful:**

* Automatically detects when the form is pending.
* No need to manage local state manually for “loading” or “disabled” buttons.
* Used often in frameworks like Next.js 15 (React 19-compatible).

---

### 4️⃣ `useFormState()` — Manage form data + submission result

**Purpose:** Reads the result of a form action and updates state automatically.

```jsx
function CommentForm({ action }) {
  const [state, formAction] = useFormState(action, { message: '' });
  return (
    <form action={formAction}>
      <input name="message" />
      <button>Send</button>
      <p>{state.message}</p>
    </form>
  );
}
```

✅ **Why it’s useful:**

* Simplifies integrating form submission logic and result state.
* Automatically re-renders with updated data returned from the form action.

---

### 5️⃣ `useActionState()` — Handle async form or action results

**Purpose:** A general hook for managing the **state of an async action**, including optimistic updates.

```jsx
function SaveButton({ action }) {
  const [state, handleAction, isPending] = useActionState(action, null);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => handleAction()} disabled={isPending}>
      {isPending ? 'Saving…' : 'Save'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

✅ **Why it’s useful:**

* Handles async actions (like form submissions, mutations).
* Tracks pending / success / error states automatically.

---

### 6️⃣ `useEffectEvent()` *(experimental but part of React 19)*

**Purpose:** Lets you create event handlers that **don’t capture stale state** inside effects.

```jsx
function Search({ query }) {
  const fetchData = useEffectEvent(() => {
    console.log('Fetching for', query);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(fetchData, 2000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, [fetchData]);
}
```

✅ **Why it’s useful:**

* Fixes common “stale closure” issues in effects.
* You can safely use it for event callbacks in effects without dependencies exploding.

| `useFormState()`   | Manage form data + submission result            | `useReducer` / `useState` for form handling |
| `useActionState()` | Manage async actions with pending/success/error | Manual async handling                       |
| `useEffectEvent()` | Safe event handlers inside effects              | Workarounds for stale closures              |

---

### 💡 In short

React 19’s new hooks focus on:

* **Async simplification** → `use()`, `useActionState()`
* **Better forms** → `useFormStatus()`, `useFormState()`
* **Optimistic updates** → `useOptimistic()`
* **Effect correctness** → `useEffectEvent()`

---

Would you like me to show a **real example combining `useOptimistic` and `useFormStatus`** — e.g. a working optimistic form that updates immediately and then syncs with the server?

## Q.6 new added hooks in react 18 ? 
Great question 👍 — React **18** also introduced a few **new hooks**, though not as many as React 19.

React 18 was mainly focused on **concurrent rendering**, **automatic batching**, and **transition APIs**, but it *did* bring several new built-in hooks that enable these features and improve performance and correctness.

Let’s go through them one by one 👇

---

## 🧩 🆕 **New Hooks Introduced in React 18**

---

### 1️⃣ `useId()`

**Purpose:**
Generate a **unique, stable ID** for accessibility attributes (`id`, `htmlFor`, etc.) that remains consistent across server and client renders.

```jsx
function FormField() {
  const id = useId();
  return (
    <>
      <label htmlFor={id}>Email:</label>
      <input id={id} type="email" />
    </>
  );
}
```

✅ **Why it’s useful:**

* Prevents ID mismatches between server and client rendering (SSR hydration issues).
* Guarantees uniqueness across the app.

---

### 2️⃣ `useTransition()`

**Purpose:**
Marks certain state updates as **“non-urgent”** (transitions).
It allows React to keep the UI responsive while deferring heavier updates.

```jsx
function Search() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  function handleChange(e) {
    const value = e.target.value;
    setQuery(value);

    startTransition(() => {
      const filtered = searchItems(value);
      setResults(filtered);
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input value={query} onChange={handleChange} />
      {isPending && <p>Loading...</p>}
      <ResultsList data={results} />
    </>
  );
}
```

✅ **Why it’s useful:**

* Keeps input responsive even when rendering large lists.
* Great for search filters, complex UIs, or navigation transitions.

---

### 3️⃣ `useDeferredValue()`

**Purpose:**
Defer updating a piece of state to prevent blocking UI updates.
It’s like a read-only version of `useTransition` — you mark **a value**, not a function, as low-priority.

```jsx
function FilterList({ input }) {
  const deferredInput = useDeferredValue(input);
  const items = filterItems(deferredInput);

  return <List items={items} />;
}
```

✅ **Why it’s useful:**

* Smooths rendering for slow or expensive components.
* Prevents the UI from freezing during heavy computations.

---

### 4️⃣ `useSyncExternalStore()`

**Purpose:**
Provides a consistent way for external stores (like Redux, Zustand, etc.) to integrate with React’s concurrent rendering.

```jsx
import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';

const store = {
  value: 0,
  listeners: new Set(),
  subscribe(listener) { this.listeners.add(listener); return () => this.listeners.delete(listener); },
  getSnapshot() { return this.value; },
};

function Counter() {
  const value = useSyncExternalStore(
    store.subscribe,
    store.getSnapshot
  );
  return <p>Count: {value}</p>;
}
```

✅ **Why it’s useful:**

* Ensures external data sources remain consistent with concurrent rendering.
* Replaces legacy `useSubscription`.

---

### 5️⃣ `useInsertionEffect()`

**Purpose:**
Allows CSS-in-JS libraries (like Emotion or styled-components) to inject styles **before** browser paint — runs **before layout effects**.

```jsx
useInsertionEffect(() => {
  injectStyles();
}, []);
```

✅ **Why it’s useful:**

* Prevents flash-of-unstyled-content (FOUC).
* Intended for **library authors**, not everyday components.

## Q.7 useLayoutEffect

Great follow-up 👍

The hook **`useLayoutEffect`** was **not new in React 18 or 19** — it’s actually one of the **original React Hooks** introduced all the way back in **React 16.8**, when hooks were first released (February 2019).

## Q.8 Heap memory in React/ Javascript ? 
Sure! Let’s break it down carefully. Heap memory is a fundamental concept in **JavaScript**, and it’s important to understand it both in vanilla JS and in frameworks like React.

---

## 🧠 **Heap Memory in JavaScript**

### 1️⃣ What is Heap Memory?

* Heap memory is a region of **memory used for storing objects, reference types, and dynamic data**.
* In JavaScript, **primitive types** (like numbers, booleans, null, undefined) are usually stored on the **stack**, while **objects, arrays, functions, and other reference types** are stored on the **heap**.

**Key Points:**

* **Heap is large and dynamic** — it can grow as needed.
* Memory allocation is **managed automatically** by JavaScript through **garbage collection**.
* Objects are stored in heap, and variables hold **references/pointers** to those objects.

---

### 2️⃣ Example:

```javascript
let x = 10; // stored on stack
let obj = { name: "Alice", age: 25 }; // object stored in heap
let arr = [1, 2, 3]; // array stored in heap
```

**Memory Allocation:**

* `x` → stack (simple value)
* `obj` → heap (complex object)
* `arr` → heap (array object)
* `obj` and `arr` variables **store references** to the memory in the heap.

---

### 3️⃣ Garbage Collection

JavaScript automatically **frees memory in the heap** that is no longer reachable:

```javascript
let person = { name: "Bob" };
person = null; // The object in heap becomes unreachable → GC can clean it
```

**React Note:**
In React apps, if you keep references to unused objects (like state or closures in hooks), they **stay in heap**, which can lead to **memory leaks** if not handled carefully.

---

### 4️⃣ Heap vs Stack

| Feature           | Heap                       | Stack                               |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Stores            | Objects, arrays, functions | Primitive values, execution context |
| Size              | Large, dynamic             | Smaller, fixed size                 |
| Access            | Slower (via references)    | Faster (direct access)              |
| Memory management | Garbage collection         | LIFO, automatic                     |

---

### 5️⃣ React-specific context

In React:

* State objects (`useState`), props, and context values are stored in **heap memory** because they are reference types.
* Memory leaks can happen if:

  * Event listeners are not cleaned up
  * Closures capture large objects that aren’t freed
  * Components are removed but references remain

**Example in React:**

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = React.useState({ name: "Alice" }); // object in heap

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => console.log(data), 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval); // prevents memory leak
  }, [data]);

  return <div>{data.name}</div>;
}
```

Without `clearInterval`, the reference to `data` would stay in heap even after the component unmounts.

---

### 💡 Summary

* **Heap memory**: dynamic memory for objects, arrays, functions
* **Stack memory**: static memory for primitives and execution contexts
* **Garbage collection** frees unreachable objects in the heap
* In **React**, state, props, and closures often live in the heap — managing references is key to preventing leaks

## Q.9 Explain Javascript Execution Context ?
Absolutely! Let’s break **JavaScript Execution Context (EC)** down carefully. This is a core concept to understand how JS runs code, manages variables, and scopes functions.

---

## 🧠 **What is an Execution Context?**

An **Execution Context** is a **conceptual environment** where JavaScript code is **parsed, interpreted, and executed**.
It contains all the information the JS engine needs to run a piece of code.

Every time a function runs or global code executes, an execution context is created.

---

### 1️⃣ Types of Execution Context

JavaScript mainly has **three types of execution contexts**:

1. **Global Execution Context (GEC)**

   * Default context when your JS code starts running.
   * Creates the **global object** (`window` in browsers) and `this`.
   * There is **only one global context** per program.

2. **Function Execution Context (FEC)**

   * Created every time a function is invoked.
   * Each function has its **own scope**, arguments, and variables.

3. **Eval Execution Context** *(rarely used)*

   * Created when code runs inside `eval()` (not recommended in modern JS).

---

### 2️⃣ Components of an Execution Context

Every execution context has **two main phases**:

#### **A. Creation Phase**

* The JS engine scans the code to allocate memory for variables and functions.
* **Memory allocation rules:**

  * **Function declarations** → stored in memory with the actual function (hoisted fully)
  * **Variables declared with `var`** → hoisted and initialized as `undefined`
  * **Variables declared with `let` or `const`** → hoisted but in **Temporal Dead Zone** (cannot be accessed before declaration)
* Sets the value of `this` for that context.

#### **B. Execution Phase**

* JS executes the code line by line.
* Variables get their assigned values.
* Functions are invoked.

---

### 3️⃣ Example

```javascript
var a = 10;

function greet(name) {
  var message = "Hello " + name;
  console.log(message);
}

greet("Alice");
```

**Execution Context Flow:**

1. **Global Execution Context**

   * Creation phase:

     * `a` → `undefined`
     * `greet` → function object
     * `this` → `window` (in browser)
   * Execution phase:

     * `a` is assigned `10`
     * `greet` function is ready to be called

2. **Function Execution Context (`greet`)**

   * Creation phase:

     * `name` → `"Alice"`
     * `message` → `undefined`
   * Execution phase:

     * `message` assigned `"Hello Alice"`
     * `console.log` prints `"Hello Alice"`

3. After `greet` finishes → its context is **destroyed**, memory is cleared (unless referenced by closures).

---

### 4️⃣ Execution Context & Call Stack

* JS uses a **call stack** to keep track of execution contexts:

```text
Stack after calling greet():
---------------------------------
| greet() EC                  |
---------------------------------
| Global EC                   |
---------------------------------
```

* When the function finishes, its EC is **popped off the stack**.

---

### 5️⃣ Hoisting & Execution Context

Execution context explains **hoisting**:

```javascript
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 5;

hello(); // works
function hello() { console.log("Hi"); }
```

**Why it works:**

* Variables are hoisted (`var a` → undefined)
* Functions are hoisted entirely (function object exists in memory before execution)

---

### 6️⃣ Key Takeaways

* **Execution Context** = environment for code execution
* **Global context** → first EC created
* **Function context** → created whenever a function runs
* **Creation phase** → memory allocation + hoisting
* **Execution phase** → code executed line by line
* Managed via **Call Stack** → LIFO (Last In First Out)

---

If you want, I can also make a **diagram showing global EC, function EC, hoisting, and call stack** — it really makes this concept click visually.

Do you want me to draw that?
