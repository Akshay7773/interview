Hi, good morning.
My name is Akshay Gawade. I'm currently working at Brillio Pvt. Ltd. as a Senior Software Developer. I have a total of 3.8 years of experience, primarily as a MERN and PERN stack developer.

In terms of technologies, I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS on the frontend, along with frameworks like Semantic UI, React MUI, and Bootstrap. 
On the backend, I work with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.

This is my second organization. Before Brillio, I worked at AngularMinds as a Software Engineer. During my time there, I contributed to several projects including an online skills assessment platform,
an applicant tracking system, and an insurance rating engine. I also worked on a product called the ByeByeSender Chrome extension, which helps users create filters within their Gmail accounts.

Currently at Brillio, I’ve been working for the past one year on two major projects — PIDS and TAMS — which are mainly focused on managing pole information data. Alongside development,
I’ve also gained experience with various AWS services such as S3, Lambda functions, Cognito, IAM, and a few others.

That’s a brief overview of my background. Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself.
