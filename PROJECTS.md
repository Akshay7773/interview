# 1. INSURANCE RATING ENGINE : 

## Interviewer: Can you tell me about the Insurance Rating Engine (ERP) project you worked on?

You: In this system we have automated the entire process of insurance company, right from the leads
to Bind Policy. It's essentially an end-to-end solution that 
automates everything from lead generation to policy issuance.


## Interviewer: Could you walk me through the main features and functionalities of the system?

You: Of course! The system is divided into several modules, each serving a specific purpose in the insurance process. We've got modules for leads management, rate comparison, proposal creation,
firm legal quote generation, document management, policy binding, and accounting and payments.


## Interviewer: Can you give me an example of how the system works?

You: Sure! Let's say an agent enters insured information into the system to create an indication. This indication then undergoes rating and pricing, where the system calculates premiums, 
policy costs, and fees. After that, underwriters review the indication and either approve or decline based on eligibility criteria. Once approved, the system generates a quote pack PDF, 
which consolidates all the indication details into a formal document. This pack is then signed manually or electronically, and additional documents are uploaded and merged.
Finally, the system uses these finalized documents to create and issue policies to the insured parties.


## Interviewer: What's the main benefit of using this system for insurance companies?

You: The main benefit is efficiency. By automating and streamlining these processes, insurance companies can save time, reduce errors, and improve overall productivity.
Plus, with features like rate comparison and firm legal quote generation, they can make more informed decisions and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.


## Interviewer: That sounds impressive! How does your project contribute to the broader goals of the company?

You: Our project aligns with the company's goals of staying competitive in the insurance market and providing exceptional service to our customers. By leveraging technology to optimize our
processes, we can better serve our clients, drive growth, and maintain our position as a leader in the industry.

# 2. MEDICATION IOT PROJECT


## Interviewer: Tell me about your experience working on the Medication IoT Project.

You: Certainly! The Medication IoT Project is an innovative system designed to streamline medication management using IoT devices, web, and mobile applications. Essentially, it's a comprehensive solution that enables users and their caregivers to track medication intake effectively.


## Interviewer: Can you walk me through the main features of the project?

You: Absolutely! The system allows users or their doctors to add medicines through a mobile app or web interface, with notifications reminding users to take their medications on time. Users and doctors can view medication intake stats, adjust schedules as needed, and track adherence history. The web application, built with Angular 8, consumes the same REST APIs as the mobile app, ensuring seamless functionality across platforms.


## Interviewer: What's the significance of this project in the healthcare sector?

You: This project drives patient empowerment by allowing capable patients to self-administer medications in hospitals using IoT devices like Pillpresso. This not only enhances their medication knowledge but also facilitates a smooth transition to home care. Additionally, it saves time for nurses by reducing the effort required for medication administration, particularly for stable or capable patients.



## Interviewer: As a Front-End Developer, what were your main responsibilities on this project?

You: My role involved collaborating with team members to design and implement visually appealing user interfaces. I was responsible for identifying and resolving front-end code issues, ensuring functionality through unit tests, and creating comprehensive documentation. Additionally, I ensured that the front-end code effectively interacted with the backend APIs and conducted performance audits to optimize code efficiency.



## Interviewer: What impact do you believe this project has had on healthcare delivery?

You: The project has had a significant impact on healthcare delivery by improving medication adherence, enhancing patient autonomy, and optimizing nursing workflows. By leveraging IoT technology and user-friendly interfaces, we've made medication management more accessible, efficient, and empowering for both patients and healthcare providers.
