## Q. 1 Node js is single threaded or multi-threaded? How can we make node application multi threaded? 
Node.js is primarily single-threaded. It uses an event-driven architecture, based on the JavaScript event loop, which allows it to handle concurrent operations without multiple threads. This single-threaded model can handle asynchronous I/O operations efficiently, making it suitable for building scalable and high-performance applications.

However, Node.js does support multi-threaded operations through the use of Worker Threads API introduced in Node.js version 10.5.0.

 This allows developers to create new threads for CPU-intensive tasks, while the main event loop remains single-threaded for handling I/O operations. This feature is particularly useful for tasks like CPU-bound computations, image processing, or intensive data manipulation, where parallel processing can improve performance without blocking the event loop.

## Example :

Sure, here's a simple example demonstrating the use of Node.js Worker Threads API:

```jsx
const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort, workerData } = require('worker_threads');

if (isMainThread) {
  // This code runs in the main thread
  const worker = new Worker(__filename, {
    workerData: { input: 10 }
  });

  worker.on('message', (result) => {
    console.log('Result from worker:', result);
  });

  worker.on('error', (error) => {
    console.error('Error in worker:', error);
  });
} else {
  // This code runs in the worker thread
  const { input } = workerData;

  // Simulating a CPU-bound task (calculating factorial)
  const factorial = calculateFactorial(input);

  // Sending the result back to the main thread
  parentPort.postMessage(factorial);
}

function calculateFactorial(n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
}

```

In this example:

- The main thread creates a new worker using the `Worker` constructor, passing the filename (`__filename`) and `workerData` as options. This data (`{ input: 10 }`) is sent to the worker thread.
- The worker thread performs a CPU-bound task, calculating the factorial of the input number received from the main thread (`input: 10` in this case).
- Once the worker thread has completed the task, it sends the result back to the main thread using `parentPort.postMessage()`.
- The main thread listens for messages from the worker thread using `worker.on('message', ...)`, and when it receives the result, it logs it to the console.

This way, the CPU-intensive task (calculating the factorial) is offloaded to a separate thread, allowing the main thread to remain responsive and handle other tasks concurrently.

## Q.2 What is event loop in node js ? 
it's the mechanism that allows Node.js to handle asynchronous operations efficiently without blocking the execution of other tasks. Here's a brief overview of how the event loop works in Node.js:

1. **Event-driven Architecture**: Node.js is built on an event-driven architecture. This means that it relies heavily on events and callbacks to handle I/O operations and other asynchronous tasks.
2. **Single-threaded**: Node.js is single-threaded, meaning it uses only one thread to execute JavaScript code. This thread is responsible for running the event loop and executing JavaScript callbacks.
3. **Non-blocking I/O**: Node.js uses non-blocking I/O operations, which means that when a function initiates an I/O operation (such as reading from a file or making an HTTP request), it doesn't wait for the operation to complete. Instead, it continues executing other tasks while the operation is performed asynchronously in the background.
4. **Event Loop**: The event loop is the core mechanism that allows Node.js to handle asynchronous operations. It continuously checks for events in the event queue and executes their associated callbacks.
    - **Event Queue**: When an asynchronous operation completes or an event occurs, its callback is pushed into the event queue.
    - **Event Loop**: The event loop continuously checks the event queue for pending events. If there are any events in the queue, it dequeues them one by one and executes their callbacks.
    - **Callback Execution**: When a callback is executed, it can initiate further asynchronous operations or perform other tasks. Once the callback finishes executing, the event loop moves on to the next event in the queue.
5. **Concurrency**: Despite being single-threaded, Node.js can handle concurrent operations effectively by leveraging asynchronous I/O and the event loop. This allows it to serve multiple clients simultaneously without blocking the execution of other tasks.

In summary, the event loop is the heart of Node.js, enabling it to handle asynchronous operations efficiently and maintain high concurrency while remaining single-threaded. Understanding how the event loop works is crucial for building scalable and performant Node.js applications.
