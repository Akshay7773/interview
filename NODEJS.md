## Q. 1 Node js is single threaded or multi-threaded? How can we make node application multi threaded? 
Node.js is primarily single-threaded. It uses an event-driven architecture, based on the JavaScript event loop, which allows it to handle concurrent operations without multiple threads. This single-threaded model can handle asynchronous I/O operations efficiently.

However, Node.js does support multi-threaded operations through the use of Worker Threads API introduced in Node.js version 10.5.0.

 This allows developers to create new threads for CPU-intensive tasks, while the main event loop remains single-threaded for handling I/O operations. This feature is particularly useful for tasks like CPU-bound computations, image processing, or intensive data manipulation, where parallel processing can improve performance without blocking the event loop.

## Example :

Sure, here's a simple example demonstrating the use of Node.js Worker Threads API:

```jsx
const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort, workerData } = require('worker_threads');

if (isMainThread) {
  // This code runs in the main thread
  const worker = new Worker(__filename, {
    workerData: { input: 10 }
  });

  worker.on('message', (result) => {
    console.log('Result from worker:', result);
  });

  worker.on('error', (error) => {
    console.error('Error in worker:', error);
  });
} else {
  // This code runs in the worker thread
  const { input } = workerData;

  // Simulating a CPU-bound task (calculating factorial)
  const factorial = calculateFactorial(input);

  // Sending the result back to the main thread
  parentPort.postMessage(factorial);
}

function calculateFactorial(n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
}

```

In this example:

- The main thread creates a new worker using the `Worker` constructor, passing the filename (`__filename`) and `workerData` as options. This data (`{ input: 10 }`) is sent to the worker thread.
- The worker thread performs a CPU-bound task, calculating the factorial of the input number received from the main thread (`input: 10` in this case).
- Once the worker thread has completed the task, it sends the result back to the main thread using `parentPort.postMessage()`.
- The main thread listens for messages from the worker thread using `worker.on('message', ...)`, and when it receives the result, it logs it to the console.

This way, the CPU-intensive task (calculating the factorial) is offloaded to a separate thread, allowing the main thread to remain responsive and handle other tasks concurrently.

## Q.2 What is event loop in node js ? 
it's the mechanism that allows Node.js to handle asynchronous operations efficiently without blocking the execution of other tasks. Here's a brief overview of how the event loop works in Node.js:

1. **Event-driven Architecture**: Node.js is built on an event-driven architecture. This means that it relies heavily on events and callbacks to handle I/O operations and other asynchronous tasks.
2. **Single-threaded**: Node.js is single-threaded, meaning it uses only one thread to execute JavaScript code. This thread is responsible for running the event loop and executing JavaScript callbacks.
3. **Non-blocking I/O**: Node.js uses non-blocking I/O operations, which means that when a function initiates an I/O operation (such as reading from a file or making an HTTP request), it doesn't wait for the operation to complete. Instead, it continues executing other tasks while the operation is performed asynchronously in the background.
4. **Event Loop**: The event loop is the core mechanism that allows Node.js to handle asynchronous operations. It continuously checks for events in the event queue and executes their associated callbacks.
    - **Event Queue**: When an asynchronous operation completes or an event occurs, its callback is pushed into the event queue.
    - **Event Loop**: The event loop continuously checks the event queue for pending events. If there are any events in the queue, it dequeues them one by one and executes their callbacks.
    - **Callback Execution**: When a callback is executed, it can initiate further asynchronous operations or perform other tasks. Once the callback finishes executing, the event loop moves on to the next event in the queue.
5. **Concurrency**: Despite being single-threaded, Node.js can handle concurrent operations effectively by leveraging asynchronous I/O and the event loop. This allows it to serve multiple clients simultaneously without blocking the execution of other tasks.

In summary, the event loop is the heart of Node.js, enabling it to handle asynchronous operations efficiently and maintain high concurrency while remaining single-threaded. Understanding how the event loop works is crucial for building scalable and performant Node.js applications.

## Q. What is the difference betweeen services and controller in nodejs ? 
### Controllers vs. Services in Node.js

**Controllers** and **Services** serve distinct roles in a Node.js application, especially when following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

#### Controllers
- **Purpose**: Handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Map HTTP requests to functions.
  - Validate incoming data.
  - Format and send responses.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  // userController.js
  const userService = require('../services/userService');

  exports.getUser = async (req, res) => {
    try {
      const user = await userService.findUserById(req.params.id);
      res.status(200).json(user);
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(500).json({ message: error.message });
    }
  };

  exports.createUser = async (req, res) => {
    try {
      const user = await userService.createUser(req.body);
      res.status(201).json(user);
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(400).json({ message: error.message });
    }
  };
  ```

#### Services
- **Purpose**: Contain business logic and interact with the data layer.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Implement core application logic.
  - Perform data operations (query, update, delete).
  - Ensure reusability across different controllers.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  // userService.js
  const User = require('../models/User');

  exports.findUserById = async (id) => {
    try {
      return await User.findById(id);
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error('User not found');
    }
  };

  exports.createUser = async (userData) => {
    try {
      const user = new User(userData);
      return await user.save();
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error('Error creating user');
    }
  };
  ```

### Key Differences
- **Focus**:
  - **Controllers**: Handle HTTP interactions.
  - **Services**: Handle business logic and data manipulation.
- **Scope**:
  - **Controllers**: Tied to specific routes.
  - **Services**: Reusable across multiple controllers.
- **Dependencies**:
  - **Controllers**: Depend on services for business logic.
  - **Services**: Interact with models or other services, independent of HTTP layer.

This division ensures a clean, modular architecture, making the application easier to maintain, test, and scale.

## multer example in node js 
```jsx
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

// Set up storage engine
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, 'uploads/');
  },
  filename: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, file.fieldname + '-' + Date.now() + path.extname(file.originalname));
  }
});

// Initialize upload
const upload = multer({
  storage: storage,
  limits: { fileSize: 1000000 }, // 1MB file size limit
  fileFilter: function (req, file, cb) {
    checkFileType(file, cb);
  }
}).single('myImage'); // 'myImage' is the name of the file input field

// Check file type
function checkFileType(file, cb) {
  // Allowed ext
  const filetypes = /jpeg|jpg|png|gif/;
  // Check ext
  const extname = filetypes.test(path.extname(file.originalname).toLowerCase());
  // Check mime
  const mimetype = filetypes.test(file.mimetype);

  if (mimetype && extname) {
    return cb(null, true);
  } else {
    cb('Error: Images Only!');
  }
}

// Route to handle file upload
app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  upload(req, res, (err) => {
    if (err) {
      res.status(400).send({ msg: err });
    } else {
      if (req.file == undefined) {
        res.status(400).send({ msg: 'No file selected!' });
      } else {
        res.send({
          msg: 'File uploaded!',
          file: `uploads/${req.file.filename}`
        });
      }
    }
  });
});

// Start server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});



```

## How actually event loop works with callback and microtask Queue? 
In Node.js, the event loop is a fundamental concept for understanding how asynchronous operations are handled. Callbacks and microtasks play crucial roles within this event loop.

1. **Callback Queue**: After the timer gets expired, the callback function is put inside the Callback Queue, and the Event Loop checks if the Call Stack is empty and if empty, pushes the callback function from Callback Queue to Call Stack and the callback function gets removed from the Callback Queue. Then the Call Stack creates an Execution Context and executes it. Sometimes this callback queue is also referred as Task Queue or Macrotask queue.

2. **Event Loop**: The event loop continuously checks the call stack and the callback queue. If the call stack is empty, it takes the first callback from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.

3. **Microtask Queue**:Microtask Queue is like the Callback Queue, but Microtask Queue has higher priority. All the callback functions coming through Promises and Mutation Observer will go inside the Microtask Queue. For example, in the case of .fetch(), the callback function gets to the Microtask Queue. Promise handling always has higher priority so the JavaScript engine executes all the tasks from Microtask Queue and then moves to the Callback Queue.




Here's a simplified sequence of how this works:

1. Asynchronous operations (e.g., file reading, network requests, timers) are initiated.
2. Once an asynchronous operation completes, its callback is placed in the callback queue.
3. The event loop checks if the call stack is empty. If so, it takes the first callback from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.
4. If the callback contains microtasks (e.g., promises or `process.nextTick()`), those microtasks are executed before the next event loop iteration.
5. The event loop continues this process, ensuring asynchronous operations are executed in a non-blocking manner.


### Difference between callback and microtask queue : 
1. Callback Queue: <br>
   a. Callback Queue gets the ordinary callback functions coming from the setTimeout() API after the timer expires. <br>
   b. Callback Queue has lesser priority than Microtask Queue of fetching the callback functions to Event Loop. <br>

2. Microtask Queue: <br>
   a. Microtask Queue gets the callback functions coming through Promises and Mutation Observer. <br> 
   b. Microtask Queue has higher priority than Callback Queue of fetching the callback functions to Event Loop. <br>

## Q.3 what is callback and callback hell? 
## Callback:

In Node.js, a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is invoked when that function completes its operation. Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous programming to handle the result of an asynchronous operation or to perform some action after the completion of an operation.

## Callback hell :

Callback hell, also known as "pyramid of doom" or "callback spaghetti," is a situation that arises in asynchronous JavaScript programming when multiple nested callbacks are used within one another. This often occurs when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations that depend on the results of each other, leading to deeply nested and hard-to-read code.

Here's an example of callback hell:

```jsx
asyncFunction1(param1, (err, result1) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error in asyncFunction1:', err);
  } else {
    asyncFunction2(result1, (err, result2) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error('Error in asyncFunction2:', err);
      } else {
        asyncFunction3(result2, (err, result3) => {
          if (err) {
            console.error('Error in asyncFunction3:', err);
          } else {
            // More nested callbacks...
          }
        });
      }
    });
  }
});

```

As you can see, each asynchronous function call requires a callback to handle the result or error of the operation. When multiple asynchronous operations are nested like this, the code becomes difficult to read, understand, and maintain. It also makes error handling more complex and error-prone.

Callback hell can make code:

1. **Hard to Read**: With multiple levels of indentation, the code becomes difficult to follow and understand.
2. **Difficult to Maintain**: Adding or modifying functionality requires navigating through deeply nested callbacks, increasing the risk of introducing bugs.
3. **Error-Prone**: Error handling becomes cumbersome, as each callback needs to handle errors separately, leading to repetitive error-handling code.

To mitigate callback hell, developers can use techniques such as:

- **Named Functions**: Define named functions for callbacks to make code more readable and reduce nesting.
- **Promises**: Use Promises to handle asynchronous operations and chain them together using `.then()` and `.catch()` methods, providing better readability and error handling.
- **Async/Await**: Use `async` functions and `await` keyword to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style, making it easier to read and maintain.

By employing these techniques, developers can write more readable and maintainable asynchronous code while avoiding callback hell.

## Q.4 What is express? 
Express is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs. It provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications quickly and easily. Here are some key aspects of Express:

1. **Routing**: Express provides a simple and intuitive way to define routes for handling HTTP requests. You can define routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and specify the corresponding handler functions to execute when those routes are matched.
2. **Middleware**: Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. They can modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function. Express allows you to use built-in middleware or write custom middleware to perform tasks such as logging, authentication, error handling, etc.
3. **Template Engines**: Express supports various template engines, such as Pug (formerly known as Jade), EJS (Embedded JavaScript), Handlebars, etc., allowing you to dynamically generate HTML markup to send as responses to clients.
4. **Static File Serving**: Express provides middleware to serve static files, such as HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript files, directly to clients without the need for custom route handlers.
5. **Error Handling**: Express has built-in error-handling middleware that you can use to handle errors that occur during request processing. You can define error-handling middleware with four parameters (`err`, `req`, `res`, and `next`) to handle errors and send appropriate responses to clients.
6. **RESTful API Development**: Express is commonly used for building RESTful APIs due to its simplicity and flexibility. You can define routes, handle different HTTP methods, and send JSON responses to clients, making it ideal for building backend services.
7. **Community and Ecosystem**: Express has a large and active community of developers, which has led to the creation of numerous third-party middleware, plugins, and extensions that extend its functionality. This ecosystem makes it easy to integrate with other libraries and frameworks, such as database libraries (e.g., Mongoose for MongoDB), authentication middleware (e.g., Passport.js), and more.

Overall, Express is widely used in the Node.js ecosystem for building web applications and APIs due to its simplicity, flexibility, and robust features. It abstracts away much of the complexity of raw HTTP server handling, allowing developers to focus on building features and functionality for their applications.

## Q.5 What is streaming ? 
Streaming in Node.js refers to the ability to read from or write to a continuous flow of data in small chunks, rather than loading the entire data into memory at once. This enables efficient processing of large datasets and reduces memory consumption

e.g. Youtube, we dont wait for the entire video download, video will start playing when some of the data is downloaded.

i.e. The contents arrive in chunks and you watch in chunks while the rest of the data arrives over time.Process streams of data in chunks as they arrive instead of waiting for the entire data to be available before processing.


Buffer:
	suppose in hall there is only 30 people seating arrangement, but remaining 70 out of 100 needs to wait,
	So the area where people waits is nothing but the buffer.

 e.g.  streming a video online 
		If your connection is fast enough, the speed of the stream will be fast enough to instantly fill up the buffer and send it out for processing. That will repeat till the stream is finished. If your connection is slow, after processing the first chunk of data that arrived, the video player will display a loading spinner which indicates it is waiting for more data to arrive. Once the buffer is filled up and data is processed, the video player shows the video.


**Types of Streaming :** 

1. **Readable Streams**: Readable streams allow you to read data from a source, such as a file, network connection, or even a generated data stream. Examples of readable streams include reading from a file using **`fs.createReadStream()`** or receiving HTTP requests using **`req`** object in an HTTP server.
2. **Writable Streams**: Writable streams allow you to write data to a destination, such as a file, network connection, or another process. Examples of writable streams include writing to a file using **`fs.createWriteStream()`** or sending HTTP responses using **`res`** object in an HTTP server.
3. **Duplex Streams**: Duplex streams represent streams that are both readable and writable, allowing for bidirectional data flow. TCP sockets are examples of duplex streams, where data can be both sent and received simultaneously.
4. **Transform Streams**: Transform streams are a type of duplex stream that allows you to modify or transform the data as it passes through the stream. Transform streams are commonly used for tasks such as compression, encryption, or data manipulation. Examples of transform streams include **`zlib.createGzip()`** for compressing data or **`crypto.createCipher()`** for encrypting data.


<br>

## Q.6 What is event Emitter ? 
EventEmitter is a class in node.js that is responsible for handling the events created using the ‘events’ module in node.js. Events are created to make custom operations while a set of operations is performed. EventEmitter can return two properties namely newListener if we want to create a new event listener and removeListener when we want to remove existing event listeners. Both of these mentioned properties emit an event whenever called to perform the operation.
In order to perform operations on EventEmitter, we need to create a reference using the ‘events’ module and then we need to initialize an instance of the EventEmitter so that we can use it further. 

Here's how it works:

1. **Emitting Events**: An object that inherits from **`EventEmitter`** can emit named events. These events can carry data or be simple notifications that something has occurred. Events are emitted using the **`emit()`** method, specifying the event name and optionally passing data as arguments.
2. **Listening for Events**: Other parts of the application can listen for specific events emitted by an **`EventEmitter`** object. Event listeners are registered using the **`on()`** method, specifying the event name and a callback function to be executed when the event is emitted.
3. **Handling Events**: When an event is emitted, all registered listeners for that event are invoked asynchronously, in the order they were registered. Each listener's callback function is executed with any data passed to the **`emit()`** method.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the use of Event Emitters in Node.js:

```jsx

const EventEmitter = require('events');

// Create a new EventEmitter instance
const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// Register an event listener for the 'greet' event
myEmitter.on('greet', (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
});

// Emit the 'greet' event with a parameter
myEmitter.emit('greet', 'John');

```



<br>

## Q.7 What is middleware and how it works ? 
Middleware in Node.js refers to functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware functions can perform tasks such as modifying the request and response objects, ending the request-response cycle, calling the next middleware function, or performing other operations.

 Middleware functions can be used to perform tasks such as:

1. Logging: Logging information about incoming requests, such as the request method, URL, and headers.
2. Authentication: Verifying the identity of users and restricting access to certain routes or resources.
3. Authorization: Checking whether a user has permission to access a particular resource.
4. Error handling: Catching and handling errors that occur during request processing.
5. Parsing request body: Parsing the body of incoming requests to extract data sent by clients.
6. Compressing response data: Compressing response data before sending it to clients to reduce bandwidth usage.
7. Caching: Caching responses to improve performance and reduce server load.

Middleware functions are executed sequentially in the order they are added to the Express application. When a request is received by the Express application, it passes through each middleware function in the middleware stack until a middleware function ends the request-response cycle by sending a response or calling the `next()` function to pass control to the next middleware function.

Here's a basic example of using middleware in an Express application:

```jsx
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware function to log information about incoming requests
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Incoming ${req.method} request to ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Call the next middleware function
});

// Route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// Middleware function to handle errors
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
});

// Start the server
const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}`);
});

```

In this example:

- We define a middleware function to log information about incoming requests using `app.use()`. This middleware function logs the HTTP method and URL of each incoming request.
- We define a route handler for the root path (`'/'`) that sends a simple greeting message in response to incoming GET requests.
- We define another middleware function to handle errors. This middleware function is called whenever an error occurs during request processing.
- We start the Express server and listen for incoming requests on port 3000.

Middleware functions allow you to modularize your application's request-handling logic and add reusable functionality to your Express application. They play a crucial role in defining the behavior of an Express application and are used extensively in building web servers and APIs with Node.js.

## Q.8 How can we overcame callback hell ? 
Callback hell, also known as "pyramid of doom," occurs when multiple asynchronous operations are nested within one another, resulting in deeply nested and hard-to-read code. To overcome callback hell and write more maintainable and readable asynchronous code in Node.js, you can use several approaches:

1. **Use Promises**: Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks. You can use the `Promise` constructor to create promises for asynchronous tasks and chain them together using `.then()` and `.catch()` methods. Promises allow you to avoid deeply nested callbacks and handle errors more effectively.
    
    Example using Promises:
    
    ```jsx
    asyncFunction1(param1)
      .then(result1 => asyncFunction2(result1))
      .then(result2 => asyncFunction3(result2))
      .then(result3 => {
        // Handle final result
      })
      .catch(error => {
        // Handle errors
      });
    
    ```
    
2. **Use Async/Await**: Async/Await is a syntactic sugar built on top of Promises that allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style. You can use the `async` keyword to define asynchronous functions and the `await` keyword to pause execution until a Promise is resolved or rejected.
    
    Example using Async/Await:
    
    ```jsx
    async function processData() {
      try {
        const result1 = await asyncFunction1(param1);
        const result2 = await asyncFunction2(result1);
        const result3 = await asyncFunction3(result2);
        // Handle final result
      } catch (error) {
        // Handle errors
      }
    }
    
    ```
    
3. **Modularize Code**: Break down your code into smaller, more manageable functions and modules. This makes it easier to reason about and test individual pieces of functionality, reducing the complexity of nested callbacks.
4. **Use Control Flow Libraries**: There are several control flow libraries and utilities available in the Node.js ecosystem, such as `async.js` and `lodash`, which provide functions for handling asynchronous operations in a more organized and readable manner.
5. **Use Function Composition**: Instead of nesting callbacks, you can use functional programming techniques such as function composition and higher-order functions to compose asynchronous operations more elegantly.
6. **Use Named Functions**: Define named functions for callbacks instead of anonymous functions. Named functions make your code more readable and easier to understand, especially when dealing with complex asynchronous operations.

By adopting these approaches, you can effectively overcome callback hell and write more maintainable and readable asynchronous code in Node.js. Choose the approach that best fits your project requirements and coding style preferences.



## Q.9 What is Promise? 
A Promise in JavaScript is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value. Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous tasks compared to traditional callback-based approaches.

A Promise can be in one of three states:

1. **Pending**: The initial state of a Promise. It represents that the asynchronous operation has not completed yet, and the Promise is still pending for the result.
2. **Fulfilled**: The state of a Promise when the asynchronous operation has completed successfully. The Promise is fulfilled with a value, which can be accessed using the `.then()` method.
3. **Rejected**: The state of a Promise when the asynchronous operation has encountered an error or failed. The Promise is rejected with a reason, which can be an error object or any other value. Rejected Promises can be handled using the `.catch()` method.

Here's a basic example of creating and using a Promise in JavaScript:

```jsx
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Simulate an asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data)
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
    // Resolve the Promise with the data
    resolve(data);
    // If an error occurs, reject the Promise
    // reject(new Error('Failed to fetch data'));
  }, 1000); // Simulate a delay of 1 second
});

// Using the Promise
myPromise.then((data) => {
  console.log('Data fetched successfully:', data);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
});

```

In this example:

- We create a new Promise using the `Promise` constructor. Inside the constructor, we define an asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data) using a setTimeout function.
- If the asynchronous operation completes successfully, we call the `resolve()` function with the result (data). If an error occurs, we call the `reject()` function with an error object.
- We use the `.then()` method to handle the fulfillment of the Promise (when it resolves) and access the data returned by the Promise.
- We use the `.catch()` method to handle the rejection of the Promise (when it rejects) and handle any errors that occurred during the asynchronous operation.

Promises provide a more elegant and structured way to work with asynchronous code, making it easier to handle and manage asynchronous operations and their results. They are widely used in JavaScript for handling asynchronous tasks in a more readable and maintainable manner.


<br>

## Q.10 What is async/ await in node js ?
`async/await` is a syntactic sugar built on top of Promises, introduced in ECMAScript 2017 (ES8), that allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style. It provides a cleaner and more readable way to work with asynchronous operations compared to using raw Promises or callback-based approaches.

`async` functions are functions that operate asynchronously and always return a Promise. Within an `async` function, you can use the `await` keyword to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved or rejected. This allows you to write asynchronous code in a sequential and linear manner, similar to synchronous code.

Here's a basic example of using `async/await`:

```jsx
// Example asynchronous function
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
      // Simulate resolving the Promise with data after 1 second
      resolve(data);
    }, 1000);
  });
}

// Example using async/await
async function fetchDataAsync() {
  try {
    // Wait for the Promise to be resolved
    const data = await fetchData();
    console.log('Data fetched successfully:', data);
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    throw error; // Re-throw the error to propagate it
  }
}

// Calling the async function
fetchDataAsync().then((data) => {
  // Do something with the fetched data
}).catch((error) => {
  // Handle any errors that occurred
});

```

In this example:

- The `fetchData` function returns a Promise that resolves with some data after a delay of 1 second.
- The `fetchDataAsync` function is declared as `async`, which means it operates asynchronously and always returns a Promise.
- Inside `fetchDataAsync`, we use the `await` keyword to pause the execution of the function until the Promise returned by `fetchData` is resolved. This allows us to assign the resolved value (data) to the `data` variable.
- We handle errors using a `try/catch` block, allowing us to catch and handle any errors that occur during the asynchronous operation.
- We call `fetchDataAsync` and handle the resolved data or any errors using `.then()` and `.catch()` methods, just like with regular Promises.

`async/await` provides a more synchronous and intuitive way to work with asynchronous code, making it easier to read, write, and maintain. It is widely used in modern JavaScript development for handling asynchronous operations in a more readable and maintainable manner.

## Q.11 Difference between promises and async/await.
| Feature | Promises | Async/Await |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Syntax | .then() and .catch() methods | async functions and await keyword |
| Readability | Can lead to callback hell if not handled well | Provides a more synchronous and linear style |
| Error Handling | .catch() method for error handling | try/catch blocks for error handling |
| Debugging | Stack traces may not provide clear information | Error stack traces point directly to the line |
| Nested Operations | Suitable for chaining, but can be complex | Simplifies handling of nested operations |

These differences showcase how async/await simplifies the handling of asynchronous code compared to Promises, making it easier to read, write, and maintain.

## Q.12 difference between put and patch
Sure, here's a comparison table highlighting the differences between PUT and PATCH in the context of RESTful APIs:

| Feature | PUT | PATCH |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | Update or replace an existing resource entirely | Update a part of an existing resource |
| Semantics | Replaces the entire resource with the provided data | Modifies a portion of the resource with the provided data |
| Request Payload | Expects a full representation of the resource | Expects a partial representation of the resource |
| Example | Updating user profile with all fields provided | Updating user profile with only specific fields |

This table summarizes the key differences between PUT and PATCH methods in the context of updating resources in RESTful APIs.

## Q.13 what are child processes in node js ?
Normally, NodeJS does work with one thread at a time, which means it can handle tasks without waiting. However, when there’s a lot of work to be done, we use the child_process module to create additional threads. These extra threads can talk to each other using a built-in messaging system.

There are several ways to create child processes in Node.js:

1. **child_process.spawn**: This method spawns a new process using the provided command. It allows communication with the child process using standard input/output streams.
2. **child_process.exec**: used to execute shell commands asynchronously.
3. **child_process.execFile**: Similar to `child_process.exec`, but it directly executes a file instead of using a shell.
4. **child_process.fork**: **child_process.fork()** is a variant of **child_process.spawn()** allowing communication between parent and child via **send()**. It facilitates the isolation of compute-heavy tasks from the main event loop, but numerous child processes can impact performance due to each having its own memory.

These child processes can run JavaScript code or execute shell commands, and they operate independently of each other and the main Node.js process. They are useful for tasks such as parallelizing CPU-intensive operations, offloading blocking I/O operations, or running separate parts of an application in isolation.

## Q.14 what is options method in context of restAPI?
In the context of a RESTful API, the OPTIONS method is one of the HTTP methods used to provide information about the communication options available for a target resource. It is typically used to allow a client to determine which HTTP methods and headers are supported by the server for a specific resource.

When a client sends an OPTIONS request to a server, the server responds with a list of allowed methods, supported headers, and other information about the resource. This allows the client to understand what actions it can perform on that resource.

Here's a breakdown of how the OPTIONS method is commonly used in a REST API:

1. **CORS Preflight Requests**: When making cross-origin requests (requests from a different domain), browsers first send an OPTIONS request as a preflight check to determine if the actual request (e.g., GET, POST) is safe to send. The server responds with CORS headers indicating which origins, methods, and headers are allowed.
2. **Discovery and Documentation**: APIs can use the OPTIONS method to provide metadata or documentation about the available endpoints and their capabilities. This can include information such as supported HTTP methods, allowed headers, authentication requirements, and links to further documentation.
3. **Allowing Cross-Origin Requests**: In addition to CORS preflight requests, the OPTIONS method can be used to respond to direct OPTIONS requests from clients. By including appropriate CORS headers in the response, servers can explicitly allow cross-origin requests from specific origins.
4. **Server Configuration**: Some servers may use the OPTIONS method to provide information about server configuration or status. For example, an OPTIONS request to a server's root URL might return information about server version, supported features, or available endpoints.

Overall, the OPTIONS method plays an important role in enabling communication between clients and servers in a RESTful API by providing information about the available communication options and helping to enforce security policies such as CORS.

## Q.15 event loop in node js 
EVENT LOOP:
1. Javascript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing code, collecting and processing events and
executing queued sub-tasks .
2. The event loop pushes the task from the task queue to the call stack.
3. setTimeout(func1, 0) can be used to defer (stop) a function until all the pending task have been executed.

callstack
callback queue
microtask queue

WHAT COMES IN MICROTASK QUEUE:
all the callback functions which comes through promises will go inside this microtask queue.

Excluding this two all goes inside callback queue(task queue)

and mutation observer.

STARVATION OF THE CALLBACK QUEUE(TASK QUEUE):
suppose microtaskk queue have many tasks in it , then callb

======================================><===============================================================
MICROTASK QUEUE:

```jsx

console.log("first");
process.nextTick(()=>console.log("this is process.nextTick 1"))
O/P. : first
       second
       this is process.nextTick 1

 e.g. 2

 Promise.resolve().then(()=>console.log("this is Promise.resole 1"))
 process.nextTick(()=>console.log("this is process.nextTick 1 "))

 OP : this is process.nextTick 1
      this is process.nextTick 1

      NOTE :
      	ALL CALLBACKS IN nextTick queue are executed before callbacks in promise queue.

  e.g. 3
        process.nextTick(()=>console.log("next tick 1"))
	process.nextTick(()=>console.log("next tick 2"))
	Promise.resolve().then(()=>console.log("promise 1"))
	Promise.resolve().then(()=>console.log("promise 2"))
	Promise.resolve().then(()=>{
	    console.log("promise 2")
	    process.nextTick(()=>console.log("next tick in promise 2"))
	})
	Promise.resolve().then(()=>console.log("promise 3"))

	O/P:
		next tick 1
		next tick 2
		promise 1
		promise 2
		promise 2
		promise 3
		next tick in promise 2

```

## Q. 16 What is interceptor in node js 
In the context of Node.js, an interceptor is a middleware or a mechanism used to intercept and modify HTTP requests or responses before they are processed by the application's main logic. Interceptors are commonly used in frameworks like Express.js for tasks such as authentication, logging, error handling, and data transformation.

Here's how interceptors work:

1. **Request Interceptors**: Request interceptors intercept incoming HTTP requests before they reach the application's routes or controllers. They can perform tasks such as validating authentication tokens, parsing request bodies, logging request details, or modifying request headers.
2. **Response Interceptors**: Response interceptors intercept outgoing HTTP responses before they are sent back to the client. They can perform tasks such as adding custom headers to responses, transforming response data, handling errors, or logging response details.

Interceptors are typically implemented as middleware functions that are registered with the application's routing system. They intercept requests and responses as they flow through the middleware stack, allowing them to inspect and modify the data as needed.

Here's an example of how you might implement a request interceptor in an Express.js application to log incoming requests:

```jsx
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Request interceptor middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Incoming request: ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware or route handler
});

// Route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

```

In this example, the request interceptor middleware logs details about incoming requests, such as the HTTP method and URL, before passing control to the next middleware or route handler.

Interceptors provide a flexible and powerful mechanism for implementing cross-cutting concerns in Node.js applications, making them easier to manage and maintain.

## Q.17 Decorators in javascript 
In JavaScript, decorators are a feature that allow you to modify or extend the behavior of classes, methods, properties, or parameters at design time. Decorators are not natively supported in JavaScript (as of ES2022), but they are a proposed feature as part of the ECMAScript standard, and they are commonly used with tools like Babel or TypeScript.

Decorators are functions that are prefixed with the `@` symbol and can be attached to classes, methods, properties, or parameters to modify their behavior. They are typically used for various purposes such as logging, memoization, validation, authentication, or to implement aspects of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP).

Here's a basic example of how decorators might look in JavaScript using Babel or TypeScript:

```jsx
// Define a decorator function
function myDecorator(target, name, descriptor) {
    console.log('Decorator was called on:', name);
}

// Apply the decorator to a class method
class MyClass {
    @myDecorator
    myMethod() {
        console.log('Method called');
    }
}

const obj = new MyClass();
obj.myMethod(); // Output: Method called

```

In this example:

- The `myDecorator` function is a decorator that logs a message when it's applied to a method.
- It takes three arguments: `target` (the class the method belongs to), `name` (the name of the method), and `descriptor` (an object containing information about the method).
- The `@myDecorator` syntax applies the decorator to the `myMethod` of the `MyClass` class.

As mentioned earlier, in order to use decorators like this in your JavaScript code, you typically need to use a transpiler like Babel or TypeScript, as decorators are not yet officially part of the JavaScript language standard.

## Q.18 What is function composition in javascript  ?
Function composition is a fundamental concept in functional programming where you combine multiple functions to create a new function. In JavaScript, function composition involves creating a new function by chaining together multiple functions, where the output of one function becomes the input of the next function.

Here's a simple example to illustrate function composition in JavaScript:

```jsx
// Functions to compose
function add2(x) {
    return x + 2;
}

function multiply3(x) {
    return x * 3;
}

// Function composition
function compose(func1, func2) {
    return function(x) {
        return func2(func1(x));
    };
}

// Compose the functions add2 and multiply3
const composedFunction = compose(add2, multiply3);

// Test the composed function
console.log(composedFunction(3)); // Output: (3 + 2) * 3 = 15

```

In this example:

- We have two simple functions: `add2` adds 2 to its input, and `multiply3` multiplies its input by 3.
- The `compose` function takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that represents their composition.
- When we compose `add2` and `multiply3`, the result is a new function that first adds 2 to its input and then multiplies the result by 3.
- We then test the composed function by passing an input value (in this case, `3`), and we see that the result is `(3 + 2) * 3 = 15`.

Function composition allows you to create more complex functions by combining simpler functions in a declarative and composable manner. It encourages a modular approach to writing functions, making your code more readable, reusable, and easier to reason about.

## Q.19 What are buffers? 
Buffer:
	suppose in hall there is only 30 people seating arrangement, but remaining 70 out of 100 needs to wait,
	So the area where people waits is nothing but the buffer.

	e.g.  streming a video online
		If your connection is fast enough, the speed of the stream will be fast enough to instantly
		 fill up the buffer and send it out for processing.
		 
That will repeat till the stream is finished.
If your connection is slow, after processing the first chunk of data that arrived, the video player will display a loading
spinner which indicates it is waiting for more data to arrive.
Once the buffer is filled up and data is processed, the video player shows the video.

In Node.js, buffers are objects used to represent fixed-size chunks of binary data. They are similar to arrays of integers but are designed specifically to handle binary data more efficiently, especially when dealing with I/O operations, such as reading from or writing to files, network sockets, or other streams.

Here are some key points about buffers in Node.js:

1. **Fixed-size**: Buffers have a fixed size upon creation, meaning the size cannot be changed once allocated. This makes them suitable for storing data of known size, such as images, audio files, or network packets.
2. **Raw memory allocation**: Buffers are allocated from Node.js's raw memory pool, which allows for more efficient memory management compared to JavaScript arrays.
3. **Binary data manipulation**: Buffers provide methods for reading from and writing to binary data, as well as performing various manipulations like slicing, copying, and concatenating.
4. **Binary encoding**: Buffers can represent binary data in different encodings, such as UTF-8, UTF-16LE, ASCII, and others. Each character in a string is represented by one or more bytes in the buffer, depending on the encoding.
5. **Interoperability**: Buffers are commonly used for interacting with binary data from external sources or APIs, such as reading binary files, handling network communication, or working with binary protocols.

Here's a basic example of creating and manipulating a buffer in Node.js:

```jsx
// Create a buffer with 8 bytes
const buffer = Buffer.alloc(8);

// Write values into the buffer
buffer.writeInt8(10, 0);
buffer.writeInt16LE(500, 1);
buffer.writeInt32LE(2000, 3);

// Read values from the buffer
const value1 = buffer.readInt8(0);
const value2 = buffer.readInt16LE(1);
const value3 = buffer.readInt32LE(3);

console.log(value1, value2, value3); // Output: 10 500 2000

```

In this example, we create a buffer with 8 bytes using `Buffer.alloc()`, write integer values into the buffer using various methods like `writeInt8()` and `writeInt32LE()`, and then read the values back using corresponding `read` methods. Finally, we log the values to the console.


<br>

## Q.20 What are middlewares in node js ? 
In Node.js, middleware refers to a function or set of functions that are executed in between the incoming request and the final response in an application's request-response cycle. Middleware functions have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the cycle (`next`). They can perform tasks such as processing request data, modifying the request or response objects, or terminating the request-response cycle early.

Middleware functions are commonly used in web frameworks like Express.js to add functionality to the application's routing system. They can be used for tasks such as:

1. **Logging**: Middleware functions can log information about incoming requests, such as the request method, URL, and timestamp.
2. **Authentication and Authorization**: Middleware functions can authenticate users by checking their credentials and authorize access to certain routes or resources based on user roles or permissions.
3. **Parsing Request Body**: Middleware functions can parse incoming request data, such as JSON or form data, and make it available to subsequent route handlers.
4. **Error Handling**: Middleware functions can handle errors that occur during the request-response cycle and send appropriate error responses to the client.
5. **Compression**: Middleware functions can compress response data to reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance.
6. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: Middleware functions can enable CORS to allow or restrict access to resources from different origins.

Here's an example of how middleware functions are used in an Express.js application:

```jsx
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware function to log incoming requests
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
});

// Middleware function to parse JSON request body
app.use(express.json());

// Middleware function for authentication
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.headers.authorization) {
    return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }
  // Verify authentication token
  // If authentication fails, send 401 Unauthorized response
  next();
});

// Route handler
app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  // Fetch and send list of users
  res.json({ users: [{ id: 1, name: 'John' }, { id: 2, name: 'Jane' }] });
});

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
});

// Start the server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});

```

In this example:

- Middleware functions are defined using `app.use()`.
- The first middleware logs information about incoming requests.
- The second middleware parses the JSON request body.
- The third middleware performs authentication based on the presence of an authorization header.
- The `app.get('/api/users')` route handler fetches and sends a list of users.
- The last middleware handles errors that occur during the request-response cycle.

## Q.21 What is cluster module ?
CLUSTER MODULE:
we know that node is a single threaded application.
No matter how many cores you have, node only uses single core of your CPU.
This is fine for I/O operations but if the code has long running and CPU intensive operations, your application might struggle from a perfomance point of view.

for avoid this issue node introduce cluster module. The cluster module enables the creation of child processes (also called workers) that run simultaneously. All created worker share the same worker port. e.g. WITHOUT cluster module . suppose our applications have two routes , first route is taken 3 ms for fetching data and second route is taking 4 seconds for

fetching data , then if we again refreshh first route then first route also takes 4 to 5 secondds or fetching data , so to avoid this we use cluster model .

```jsx
	e.g. without cluster module
	
		const http=require("http");
		const {Worker}=require("worker_threads");
		const server=http.createServer((req, res)=>{
			if(req.url==="/"){
				res.writeHead(200,{"Content-Type":"text/plain"})
				res.end("Home page")
			}
			else if(req.url==="/slow-page"){
				let j=0;
				for(let i=0;i<200000;i++){
					j++;
				}
				res.writeHead(200,{"Content-Type":"text/plain"})
				res.end(`slow page ${j}`)

			}
		})
		server.listen(8000, ()=>console.log("server listen on port 8000"))

	e.g. with cluster

	const cluster=require("cluster");
	if(cluster.isMaster){
		console.log(`Master process ${process.pid} is running`);
		cluster.fork();
		cluster.fork();
	}
	else{
		console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started`);
		const server=http.createServer((req, res)=>{
			if(req.url==="/"){
				res.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type":"text/plain"});
				res.end("Home page");
			}else if(req.url==="/slow-page"){
				for(let i=0;i<1000000;i++){}
				res.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type":"text/plailn"})
				res.end("slow page")
			}
		})

		server.listen(8000, ()=>console.log("server up and running "))
	}

	O/P:
		Master process 3242 is running
		Worker 3244 started
		Worker 3243 started
		server up and running

		NOTE : HERE IT WILL NOT AFFECT ON / route as we use cluster.

```

## Q.22 What is worker thread module?
WORKER THREAD MODULE:
The worker thread module enables the use of threads that execute the Javascript in parallel.
Code executed in worker thread runs in a seperate child process, preventing it from blocking your main application.

```jsx
difference between cluster and worker module :
	The cluster module can be used to run multiple instances of node js that can distribute workloads.
	worker thread module allows running multiple application threads within a single Node.js instance.

e.g.

	in index.js

const http = require("http");
const { Worker } = require("worker_threads");
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === "/") {
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
    res.end("Home page");
  } else if (req.url === "/slow-page") {
    const worker = new Worker("./worker-threads.js");
    worker.on("message", (j) => {
      //for getting message in index.js from worker-threads.js
      res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
      res.end(`slow page ${j}`);
    });
  }
});
server.listen(8000, () => console.log("server listen on port 8000")) in
  worker - threads.js;

const { parentPort } = require("worker-threads");
let j = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 200000; i++) {
  j++;
}

parentPort.postMessage(j);

```

## Q.23 Common nodejs module system and es6 module systems.
 In Node.js, there are several common module systems used for organizing and modularizing code:

1. **CommonJS (CJS)**:
    - CommonJS is the default module system used in Node.js.
    - Modules are encapsulated in separate files, and each file is treated as a module.
    - Modules are loaded synchronously using the `require()` function.
    - Each module has its own scope, and module-level variables are not accessible outside the module unless explicitly exported.
    - Example:
        
        ```jsx
        // Exporting module
        module.exports = {
          foo: 'bar',
          baz: () => {}
        };
        
        // Importing module
        const module = require('./module');
        
        ```
        
2. **ES6 Modules**:
    - ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced native support for modules in JavaScript.
    - Modules are defined using `import` and `export` statements.
    - Modules have their own scope, and variables are not automatically exported unless explicitly specified using `export`.
    - Modules are loaded asynchronously and can be statically analyzed, which can lead to better performance in certain scenarios.
    - ES6 modules are commonly used in modern web development with tools like webpack, Rollup, or Parcel.
    - Example:
        
        ```jsx
        // Exporting module
        export const foo = 'bar';
        export function baz() {}
        
        // Importing module
        import { foo, baz } from './module';
        
        ```
        

Both CommonJS and ES6 modules are widely used in Node.js applications, but ES6 modules are becoming increasingly popular due to their native support in modern JavaScript environments and their advantages in terms of static analysis and performance optimization.

When writing Node.js applications, you can choose between CommonJS and ES6 modules based on your project requirements, compatibility needs, and personal preference. Keep in mind that Node.js supports both module systems, so you can mix and match them within the same project if needed. However, it's worth noting that Node.js currently requires using the `.mjs` file extension for ES6 modules, whereas CommonJS modules typically use the `.js` extension.

## Q.24 Streams in node js and its types
In Node.js, streams are objects used to handle continuous data flow, allowing you to read or write data piece by piece instead of loading the entire data set into memory at once. Streams are especially useful when dealing with large amounts of data, such as reading from or writing to files, handling network communication, or processing data in real-time.

There are four main types of streams in Node.js:

1. **Readable Streams**:
    - Readable streams represent a source from which data can be read.
    - Examples include reading data from files (`fs.createReadStream()`), receiving data from HTTP requests (`request` module), or generating data internally (`Readable` class).
    - You can consume data from readable streams using events like `'data'` or by using the `read()` method.
2. **Writable Streams**:
    - Writable streams represent a destination to which data can be written.
    - Examples include writing data to files (`fs.createWriteStream()`), sending data in HTTP responses (`response` object), or piping data to other streams (`Writable` class).
    - You can write data to writable streams using methods like `write()` or `end()`.
3. **Duplex Streams**:
    - Duplex streams represent both a readable and writable stream.
    - Examples include TCP sockets (`net.Socket`), HTTPS requests (`https.request()`), or WebSocket connections (`ws` module).
    - Duplex streams allow bidirectional communication, where data can be both sent and received simultaneously.
4. **Transform Streams**:
    - Transform streams are a special type of duplex stream that allows modifying or transforming data as it passes through the stream.
    - Examples include compressing data using gzip (`zlib.createGzip()`), encrypting data (`crypto.createCipher()`), or converting data formats (`stream.Transform` class).
    - Transform streams inherit from the `Transform` class and implement the `_transform()` method to perform data transformations.

These types of streams can be combined and piped together to create complex data processing pipelines. For example, you can read data from a file using a readable stream, transform it using a transform stream, and then write the transformed data to another file using a writable stream, all without loading the entire data set into memory at once. This makes streams a powerful and efficient tool for handling data in Node.js applications.

## Q.25 difference between synchronous and asynchronous methods in file system
Synchronous and asynchronous methods in the context of file systems refer to how data is read from or written to files and how the program interacts with the file system during these operations.

1. **Synchronous Methods**:
    - In synchronous methods, when a program initiates a file operation (like reading or writing), it typically waits until that operation is completed before moving on to the next instruction.
    - This means that the program execution is halted until the file operation finishes. During this time, the program may be unresponsive to other tasks or unable to perform other operations.
    - Synchronous methods are simpler to implement and reason about, as the program's flow of control is straightforward.
    - However, they may lead to decreased overall performance, especially in scenarios where file operations are time-consuming or when multiple operations need to be performed concurrently.
2. **Asynchronous Methods**:
    - In asynchronous methods, a program initiates a file operation but doesn't wait for it to complete. Instead, it continues executing other instructions while the file operation is being processed.
    - When the file operation is completed, the program is typically notified through a callback mechanism or by polling for completion status.
    - Asynchronous methods allow for better concurrency and responsiveness in applications, as the program can continue to perform other tasks while waiting for file operations to finish.
    - They are particularly useful in scenarios where responsiveness is crucial or when the program needs to perform multiple file operations concurrently without blocking.
    - However, asynchronous programming can be more complex to implement and reason about, as it requires managing callbacks, handling errors, and coordinating concurrent operations.

In summary, synchronous methods block the program's execution until file operations are completed, while asynchronous methods allow the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for file operations to finish, enhancing concurrency and responsiveness at the cost of increased complexity.

## Q.26  difference between cluster and work thread package in node js 
In Node.js, there are two main packages for handling concurrency and parallelism: Cluster and Worker Threads. While both are used to achieve parallel execution, they serve different purposes and have different mechanisms for achieving concurrency.

1. **Cluster**:
    - The Cluster module in Node.js allows applications to create multiple instances of the same process, known as workers, which can share the same port.
    - It's typically used to take advantage of multi-core systems by distributing incoming connections or tasks across multiple processes.
    - Each worker in a cluster operates in its own event loop, enabling parallel execution of tasks across multiple CPU cores.
    - Cluster module simplifies scaling Node.js applications horizontally, allowing them to handle more incoming requests or tasks by utilizing multiple CPU cores effectively.
    - It's particularly useful for networked applications like web servers, where incoming connections can be distributed among multiple worker processes.
2. **Worker Threads**:
    - Worker thread module allows running multiple application threads within a single Node.js instance.
    - Worker Threads, introduced in Node.js version 10.5, allow developers to create and run JavaScript code in separate threads alongside the main event loop.
    - Unlike Cluster, Worker Threads operate within a single process and share memory, enabling more efficient communication and data sharing between threads.
    - Worker Threads are typically used for CPU-bound tasks or computationally intensive operations that can benefit from parallel execution, such as heavy data processing, image manipulation, or machine learning tasks.
    - They provide a way to leverage multi-core systems without the overhead of creating separate processes, allowing Node.js applications to achieve parallelism within a single process.
    - Worker Threads are more flexible in terms of communication between threads, as they support various inter-thread communication mechanisms like MessagePort and SharedArrayBuffer.

In summary, Cluster module in Node.js is used for distributing incoming connections or tasks across multiple processes (workers) to scale applications horizontally, while Worker Threads allow parallel execution of JavaScript code within a single process, particularly useful for CPU-bound tasks or computationally intensive operations.

## Q.27 what is blocking code in node js ?
In Node.js, blocking code refers to code that prevents the event loop from continuing to run until the operation is complete. When a piece of code is blocking, it means that other tasks, including incoming requests or operations, cannot be processed until the blocking operation finishes. This can lead to decreased performance and responsiveness in Node.js applications, especially in scenarios where there are many concurrent operations or when handling I/O-bound tasks.

Examples of blocking operations in Node.js include:

1. **Synchronous File I/O**: Performing synchronous file operations like reading or writing files using methods such as `fs.readFileSync()` or `fs.writeFileSync()` can block the event loop until the operation completes.
2. **CPU-Intensive Operations**: Executing CPU-bound tasks or computationally intensive operations synchronously can block the event loop, causing delays in processing incoming requests or handling other tasks.
3. **Database Queries**: Synchronous database queries can block the event loop until the query is executed and the result is returned. This can lead to decreased performance, especially in applications with high database load or many concurrent connections.

Blocking code can have a significant impact on the performance and scalability of Node.js applications, as it prevents the event loop from efficiently handling concurrent operations. To mitigate the effects of blocking code, Node.js encourages the use of asynchronous non-blocking operations wherever possible. By using asynchronous operations and callbacks or promises, Node.js applications can continue processing other tasks while waiting for I/O operations or other asynchronous tasks to complete, leading to better performance and responsiveness.

## Q.28 what is different between require() and import in node js 
In Node.js, `require()` and `import` are both mechanisms used to include external modules or files in a Node.js application. However, they have some differences in their behavior and usage.

1. **`require()`**:
    - `require()` is the traditional way of including modules in Node.js. It's a synchronous function that loads modules at runtime.
    - It's used to import CommonJS modules, which are the standard module system in Node.js. CommonJS modules use `module.exports` to export values and `require()` to import modules.
    - `require()` is evaluated at runtime, which means that the module is loaded and executed when it's encountered in the code.
    - It doesn't support ES6 features like `import` and `export`.

Example:

```jsx
const fs = require('fs');

```

1. **`import`**:
    - `import` is part of the ECMAScript 6 (ES6) module system and is used to import modules in JavaScript. It's a declarative way of including modules.
    - `import` statements are asynchronous and are evaluated at compile time, allowing for static analysis and optimization by JavaScript engines.
    - `import` is used to import ES6 modules, which use `export` to export values and `import` to import modules.
    - ES6 modules support features like named exports, default exports, and namespace imports, which provide more flexibility compared to CommonJS modules.
    - While `import` is part of the ES6 specification, Node.js began supporting it in later versions, primarily through tools like Babel or by using the `-experimental-modules` flag in Node.js versions 12 and above.

Example:

```jsx
import fs from 'fs';

```

In summary, `require()` is the traditional way of including modules in Node.js, primarily used for CommonJS modules, while `import` is part of the ES6 module system and is used for ES6 modules. Although Node.js started supporting `import` in later versions, it's still common to see `require()` being used in existing Node.js projects, especially those that haven't migrated to ES6 modules.

## Q.29 what is assert in node js ? 
In Node.js, the `assert` module is a built-in module that provides a set of assertion functions for writing tests. These assertion functions are used to test conditions in code and throw errors if the conditions are not met, helping to ensure the correctness of programs.

The `assert` module includes several functions, some of the most commonly used ones are:

1. **`assert.ok(value[, message])`** or **`assert(value[, message])`**:
    - Tests if the `value` is truthy. If the value is falsy, it throws an `AssertionError`.
    - If `value` is not truthy, an optional `message` can be provided to include additional information in the error message.
2. **`assert.strictEqual(actual, expected[, message])`**:
    - Tests strict equality (`===`) between `actual` and `expected`.
    - If the values are not strictly equal, it throws an `AssertionError`.
    - An optional `message` can be provided to include additional information in the error message.
3. **`assert.deepEqual(actual, expected[, message])`**:
    - Tests deep equality between `actual` and `expected` objects.
    - It recursively compares properties of objects and arrays to check if they are equal.
    - If the objects are not deeply equal, it throws an `AssertionError`.
    - An optional `message` can be provided to include additional information in the error message.
4. **`assert.throws(block[, error][, message])`**:
    - Tests if `block` throws an error.
    - If `block` does not throw an error, or if the error thrown does not match the `error` parameter (if provided), it throws an `AssertionError`.
    - An optional `message` can be provided to include additional information in the error message.

These are just a few examples of the assertion functions provided by the `assert` module. The module offers additional functions for more specific assertion needs. The `assert` module is commonly used in conjunction with testing frameworks like Mocha, Jasmine, or Jest for writing unit tests and ensuring the correctness of Node.js applications.

## Q.30 can node js work without v8 engine ? 
No, Node.js cannot work without the V8 JavaScript engine. The V8 engine is a critical component of Node.js, responsible for executing JavaScript code. Node.js is built on top of the V8 engine, which is developed by Google for use in their Chrome web browser.

When you run a Node.js application, the V8 engine is responsible for parsing and executing the JavaScript code. It provides features like Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, garbage collection, and optimization of JavaScript code for performance.

While Node.js itself is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside the browser, it relies heavily on the V8 engine to interpret and execute JavaScript code. Therefore, the V8 engine is an essential dependency for Node.js, and it cannot function without it.

## Q.31 difference between process.nextTick() and setImmediate()
`process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()` are both functions provided by Node.js to schedule asynchronous operations, but they have some key differences in their behavior and when they are executed.

1. **`process.nextTick()`**:
    - `process.nextTick()` is used to schedule a callback to be invoked in the next iteration of the event loop, immediately after the current operation completes.
    - It's designed to allow deferring the execution of a callback until the current synchronous code has completed, but before the event loop continues to process I/O events.
    - Callbacks scheduled with `process.nextTick()` are executed before any I/O events (like timers, network, or file system events) are processed in the event loop.
    - Because `process.nextTick()` callbacks are executed before I/O events, they are often used for tasks that need to be executed before any I/O event processing occurs, such as setting up event listeners or initializing variables.

Example:

```jsx
process.nextTick(() => {
    console.log('This will be executed in the next tick');
});
console.log('This will be executed first');

```

1. **`setImmediate()`**:
    - `setImmediate()` is used to schedule a callback to be invoked in the next iteration of the event loop, immediately after the I/O events are processed.
    - It's designed to allow scheduling a callback to run after the current operation completes, but after any I/O events that have been triggered during the current event loop iteration have been processed.
    - Callbacks scheduled with `setImmediate()` are executed after any pending I/O events, timers, or other callbacks in the event loop queue.
    - Because `setImmediate()` callbacks are executed after I/O events, they are often used for tasks that need to be executed asynchronously but with lower priority compared to `process.nextTick()`.

Example:

```jsx
setImmediate(() => {
    console.log('This will be executed in the next event loop iteration');
});
console.log('This will be executed first');

```

In summary, the main difference between `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()` lies in when they are executed within the event loop. `process.nextTick()` callbacks are executed before I/O events, while `setImmediate()` callbacks are executed after I/O events. Both functions are used for scheduling asynchronous operations, but their execution order can affect the behavior of Node.js applications.


<br>

## Q.32 difference between async.parallel and async.series
In Node.js, the `async` module provides utilities for handling asynchronous operations, including two commonly used functions: `async.parallel()` and `async.series()`. These functions allow developers to manage asynchronous tasks in parallel or in series, respectively, and they have different behaviors and use cases.

1. **`async.parallel()`**:
    - `async.parallel()` is used to execute multiple asynchronous tasks simultaneously, in parallel.
    - It takes an array or an object of asynchronous functions (tasks) and a callback function as arguments.
    - Each task is executed independently and concurrently, without waiting for the others to complete.
    - The callback function is invoked once all tasks have completed (or encountered an error). The callback receives an array of results, where each element corresponds to the result of the corresponding task.
    - This function is useful when you have independent tasks that can be executed concurrently and you want to optimize the overall execution time by running them in parallel.

Example:

```jsx
async.parallel([
    function(callback) {
        setTimeout(function() {
            callback(null, 'Task 1');
        }, 1000);
    },
    function(callback) {
        setTimeout(function() {
            callback(null, 'Task 2');
        }, 500);
    }
], function(err, results) {
    console.log(results); // ['Task 1', 'Task 2']
});

```

1. **`async.series()`**:
    - `async.series()` is used to execute multiple asynchronous tasks sequentially, in series.
    - It takes an array or an object of asynchronous functions (tasks) and a callback function as arguments.
    - Each task is executed one after the other, in the order they are defined. The next task starts only after the previous one has completed.
    - The callback function is invoked once all tasks have completed (or encountered an error). The callback receives an array of results, where each element corresponds to the result of the corresponding task.
    - This function is useful when you have tasks that depend on the results of previous tasks or need to be executed in a specific order.

Example:

```jsx
async.series([
    function(callback) {
        setTimeout(function() {
            callback(null, 'Task 1');
        }, 1000);
    },
    function(callback) {
        setTimeout(function() {
            callback(null, 'Task 2');
        }, 500);
    }
], function(err, results) {
    console.log(results); // ['Task 1', 'Task 2']
});

```

In summary, `async.parallel()` is used to execute asynchronous tasks in parallel, optimizing execution time, while `async.series()` is used to execute tasks sequentially, ensuring a specific order of execution or dependency between tasks.

## Q.33 what is promise.all and promise.allSettled? 

In Node.js (as well as in JavaScript in general), `Promise.all()` and `Promise.allSettled()` are both methods used to handle multiple promises concurrently. They differ in how they handle the results and status of the promises being resolved.

1. **`Promise.all()`**:
    - `Promise.all()` is a method that takes an array (or an iterable) of promises as input and returns a single Promise that resolves when all of the input promises have resolved or rejects when any of the input promises reject.
    - The resolved value of the returned Promise is an array containing the resolved values of the input promises, in the same order as the input array.
    - If any of the input promises reject (i.e., one or more promises fail), the returned Promise immediately rejects with the reason of the first promise that was rejected.

Example:

```jsx
const promises = [
    Promise.resolve('Promise 1'),
    Promise.resolve('Promise 2'),
    Promise.resolve('Promise 3')
];

Promise.all(promises)
    .then(results => {
        console.log(results); // ['Promise 1', 'Promise 2', 'Promise 3']
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });

```

1. **`Promise.allSettled()`**:
    - `Promise.allSettled()` is a method that takes an array (or an iterable) of promises as input and returns a single Promise that resolves when all of the input promises have settled (i.e., either resolved or rejected).
    - The resolved value of the returned Promise is an array containing the results of all input promises, where each result is an object with either a `status` property (either `"fulfilled"` or `"rejected"`) and a `value` or `reason` property, depending on whether the promise was fulfilled or rejected.
    - Unlike `Promise.all()`, `Promise.allSettled()` does not short-circuit if one of the promises rejects. It waits for all promises to settle before resolving the returned Promise.

Example:

```jsx
const promises = [
    Promise.resolve('Promise 1'),
    Promise.reject('Promise 2 failed'),
    Promise.resolve('Promise 3')
];

Promise.allSettled(promises)
    .then(results => {
        console.log(results);
        /* [
            { status: 'fulfilled', value: 'Promise 1' },
            { status: 'rejected', reason: 'Promise 2 failed' },
            { status: 'fulfilled', value: 'Promise 3' }
        ] */
    });

```

In summary, `Promise.all()` resolves when all promises in the input array fulfill or rejects immediately if any of the promises reject. `Promise.allSettled()` resolves after all promises in the input array have settled, providing information about each promise's status and result, regardless of whether they fulfilled or rejected.

<br>


## Q.34 difference between promise.all and promise.allSettled
`Promise.all()` and `Promise.allSettled()` are both methods in JavaScript used to handle multiple promises concurrently, but they differ in how they handle the results and the behavior when one or more promises fail.

1. **`Promise.all()`**:
    - `Promise.all()` takes an array (or any iterable) of promises as input and returns a single Promise.
    - The returned Promise fulfills if and only if all of the input promises fulfill. If any of the input promises reject, `Promise.all()` immediately rejects with the reason of the first promise that was rejected.
    - The resolved value of the returned Promise is an array containing the resolved values of the input promises, in the same order as the input array.

Example:

```jsx
const promises = [
    Promise.resolve('Promise 1'),
    Promise.resolve('Promise 2'),
    Promise.resolve('Promise 3')
];

Promise.all(promises)
    .then(results => {
        console.log(results); // ['Promise 1', 'Promise 2', 'Promise 3']
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error); // This will not be executed unless one of the promises rejects
    });

```

1. **`Promise.allSettled()`**:
    - `Promise.allSettled()` takes an array (or any iterable) of promises as input and returns a single Promise.
    - The returned Promise always fulfills, after all of the input promises have settled (i.e., either fulfilled or rejected).
    - The resolved value of the returned Promise is an array containing the results of all input promises. Each result is an object with a `status` property indicating whether the promise fulfilled (`"fulfilled"`) or rejected (`"rejected"`) and a `value` or `reason` property, respectively, containing the fulfillment value or rejection reason.

Example:

```jsx
const promises = [
    Promise.resolve('Promise 1'),
    Promise.reject('Promise 2 failed'),
    Promise.resolve('Promise 3')
];

Promise.allSettled(promises)
    .then(results => {
        console.log(results);
        /* [
            { status: 'fulfilled', value: 'Promise 1' },
            { status: 'rejected', reason: 'Promise 2 failed' },
            { status: 'fulfilled', value: 'Promise 3' }
        ] */
    });

```

In summary, `Promise.all()` waits for all input promises to fulfill or rejects immediately if any of the input promises reject. `Promise.allSettled()` waits for all input promises to settle (fulfill or reject) and provides information about each promise's status and result, regardless of whether they fulfilled or rejected.

## Q.35 what are the globals which are provided by node itself in node application  
Node.js provides several global objects and functions that are available in every Node.js application without needing to require them explicitly. Some of the commonly used global objects and functions provided by Node.js include:

1. **`global`**: The `global` object serves as the global namespace in Node.js. Variables and functions defined in the global scope are attached to the `global` object.
2. **`process`**: The `process` object provides information about the current Node.js process and allows interaction with it. It provides properties and methods related to process management, environment variables, and standard I/O.
3. **`console`**: The `console` object provides methods for printing messages to the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr). It includes methods like `console.log()`, `console.error()`, `console.warn()`, etc.
4. **`require()`**: The `require()` function is used to include modules in a Node.js application. It's a global function provided by Node.js to load modules into the current application.
5. **`module`**: The `module` object represents the current module and provides information about it. It includes properties like `module.exports` and `module.id`.
6. **`exports`**: The `exports` object is used to export values from a module. It's a shorthand for `module.exports`.
7. **`__filename`**: A global variable that represents the file name of the current module with the absolute path.
8. **`__dirname`**: A global variable that represents the directory name of the current module with the absolute path.

These are some of the key globals provided by Node.js in every Node.js application. They provide essential functionalities for interacting with the runtime environment, managing processes, loading modules, and logging messages.


<br>

## Q.36 what is middleware in express?
Middleware in Express.js is a function that has access to the request (`req`), response (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware functions can perform various tasks such as modifying the request and response objects, executing code, and terminating the request-response cycle by sending a response or passing control to the next middleware function.

Middleware functions in Express can be used for a wide range of purposes, including:

1. **Logging**: Middleware can log information about incoming requests, such as the request method, URL, headers, and timestamp.
2. **Authentication and Authorization**: Middleware can verify the authenticity of requests by checking authentication tokens, session data, or user credentials. It can also enforce access control policies by checking user permissions and roles.
3. **Error Handling**: Middleware can handle errors that occur during request processing and generate appropriate error responses. Error-handling middleware typically have four parameters (err, req, res, next) and are defined with an additional argument.
4. **Parsing Request Body**: Middleware can parse incoming request bodies from various formats such as JSON, URL-encoded, or multipart form data.
5. **Request Processing**: Middleware can perform pre-processing on incoming requests, such as validating input data, sanitizing input, or performing data transformations.
6. **Response Processing**: Middleware can modify the response sent back to the client, such as adding custom headers, compressing response data, or transforming response bodies.
7. **CORS Handling**: Middleware can handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) by adding appropriate headers to responses to allow cross-origin requests.

Middleware functions in Express are added to the request-response cycle using the `app.use()` method or specific HTTP method functions (e.g., `app.get()`, `app.post()`, etc.). Middleware can be defined globally to apply to all routes or locally to apply only to specific routes or route patterns.

Here's an example of a simple middleware function in Express:

```jsx
// Custom middleware function
const myMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Request received:', req.method, req.url);
    next(); // Call next to pass control to the next middleware function
};

// Apply middleware globally
app.use(myMiddleware);

// Apply middleware locally to a specific route
app.get('/users', myMiddleware, (req, res) => {
    res.send('List of users');
});

```

In this example, the `myMiddleware` function logs information about incoming requests and passes control to the next middleware or route handler by calling `next()`. It is applied globally to all routes using `app.use()` and locally to the `/users` route using the `app.get()` method.

<br>

## Q.37 what is authentication and authorization?
Authentication and authorization are two important concepts in web application security, including those built with Node.js. They are often used together but serve different purposes:

1. **Authentication**:
    - Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity attempting to access a system or resource.
    - In the context of web applications, authentication typically involves users providing credentials (such as username and password) to prove their identity.
    - Node.js applications implement authentication mechanisms to ensure that users are who they claim to be before granting them access to protected resources.
    - Common authentication methods in Node.js applications include:
        - Username and password authentication: Users provide a username and password, which are then verified against a stored database of user credentials.
        - JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Stateless authentication mechanism where users receive a signed token upon successful authentication, which they include in subsequent requests to access protected resources.
        - OAuth and OpenID Connect: Protocols used for delegated authentication, allowing users to authenticate using third-party identity providers like Google, Facebook, or GitHub.
2. **Authorization**:
    - Authorization is the process of determining whether an authenticated user or entity has permission to access a specific resource or perform a specific action.
    - After authentication, Node.js applications enforce authorization policies to ensure that authenticated users are only allowed to access resources and perform actions that they are authorized to.
    - Authorization can be role-based or rule-based, where permissions are granted based on user roles or specific rules defined by the application.
    - Node.js applications typically implement authorization logic using middleware functions or access control mechanisms.
    - Common authorization mechanisms in Node.js applications include:
        - Role-based access control (RBAC): Users are assigned roles (e.g., admin, moderator, user), and permissions are associated with each role. Users can access resources and perform actions based on their assigned roles.
        - Attribute-based access control (ABAC): Access control decisions are based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment. Policies define rules that evaluate these attributes to determine whether access is allowed.
        - Access control lists (ACLs): Lists of permissions associated with specific resources or actions, defining which users or roles are granted access to each resource or action.

In summary, authentication verifies the identity of users or entities accessing a system, while authorization determines what resources or actions authenticated users are allowed to access or perform. Together, authentication and authorization help ensure the security and integrity of Node.js applications by controlling access to sensitive resources and data.

IMPORTANT : 

**JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**:

- JWT is a stateless authentication mechanism where users receive a signed token upon successful authentication.
- After authentication, the server issues a JWT containing user information and a signature.
- The client includes the JWT in subsequent requests to access protected resources.
- Node.js applications verify the JWT signature to authenticate users and extract user information from the token.

<br>

## suppose I havent pass lifetime in jwt ,  by default how long a token will survive ? 
JWT tokens do not have a default expiration time unless one is explicitly set by the issuer. If the expiration time (exp claim) is not specified in the JWT payload, it will not have an expiration time, and it will be considered valid indefinitely.

However, it's generally considered a security best practice to include an expiration time in JWT tokens to mitigate the risk of token theft and replay attacks. By setting an expiration time, the token becomes invalid after a certain period, reducing the window of opportunity for malicious actors to misuse it.

When implementing JWT-based authentication, it's up to the application developer to determine an appropriate expiration time based on the specific security requirements and use case of the application. Typically, JWT tokens have a relatively short expiration time, such as a few minutes to a few hours, depending on factors such as the sensitivity of the data and the risk tolerance of the application.

Including an expiration time also helps with managing server resources by ensuring that expired tokens are not unnecessarily processed or stored on the server side.


<br> 

## Q.38 middleware is related with request only or I can use it with response also ?
Middleware in Node.js, particularly in frameworks like Express.js, can be used not only with requests but also with responses. Middleware functions have access to both the request (`req`) and response (`res`) objects, allowing them to manipulate both incoming requests and outgoing responses. This makes middleware versatile for various purposes, such as logging, authentication, error handling, and response processing.

Here's how middleware can be used with both requests and responses:

1. **Request Middleware**:
    - Request middleware functions are executed before the final route handler is called.
    - They can perform tasks such as parsing request bodies, validating input, authenticating users, and handling CORS headers.
    - Request middleware functions can modify the request object (`req`) by adding or modifying properties, headers, or parameters before passing control to the next middleware or route handler.
2. **Response Middleware**:
    - Response middleware functions are executed after the final route handler has sent a response.
    - They can perform tasks such as modifying response headers, transforming response data, compressing response bodies, or logging response details.
    - Response middleware functions have access to both the request (`req`) and response (`res`) objects and can modify the response object (`res`) before it is sent back to the client.

Here's an example demonstrating how middleware can be used with both requests and responses in an Express.js application:

```jsx
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Request middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Request received:', req.method, req.url);
    next(); // Call next to pass control to the next middleware or route handler
});

// Route handler
app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// Response middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    // Modify response headers
    res.setHeader('X-Powered-By', 'Express');
    next(); // Call next to pass control to the next middleware or route handler
});

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

```

In this example, the first middleware function logs details about incoming requests, the second middleware function modifies the response headers, and the error handling middleware function logs errors and sends an error response if an error occurs during request processing. All of these middleware functions have access to both the request and response objects and can manipulate them accordingly.

## Q.39 what is event driven development in node js ? 
Event-driven development is a programming paradigm that focuses on the generation, detection, and handling of events. In Node.js, event-driven development is at the core of its architecture, allowing developers to build highly scalable and efficient applications. Here's how event-driven development works in Node.js:

1. **Event Loop**:
    - Node.js is built on top of an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, facilitated by its event loop.
    - The event loop is a single-threaded mechanism that continuously listens for events and executes callback functions in response to those events.
    - Events in Node.js can be I/O operations (such as reading from a file or making an HTTP request), timer expirations, or custom events triggered by the application.
2. **Event Emitters**:
    - In Node.js, many objects are instances of `EventEmitter`, which allows them to emit events and attach listeners to handle those events.
    - Event emitters are objects that can emit named events, along with optional data, using the `emit()` method.
    - Example built-in objects that are event emitters include `http.Server`, `fs.ReadStream`, and `process`.
3. **Event Handlers**:
    - Event handlers are functions that are registered to handle specific events emitted by event emitters.
    - Event handlers are attached to event emitters using the `on()` method or by directly assigning functions to event emitter properties.
    - When an event is emitted, all registered event handlers for that event are invoked asynchronously, in the order they were added.
4. **Event-driven Programming**:
    - In event-driven programming, developers structure their code around reacting to events rather than executing tasks in a linear sequence.
    - Event-driven programming allows for highly responsive and scalable applications, as it leverages non-blocking I/O to handle multiple concurrent operations efficiently.
    - Asynchronous programming patterns, such as callbacks, promises, and async/await, are commonly used in event-driven development to handle asynchronous operations and manage event-driven code flow.
5. **Custom Events**:
    - In addition to built-in events emitted by Node.js core modules, developers can create custom events to represent application-specific events.
    - Custom events are useful for decoupling components, allowing them to communicate with each other without tight coupling.
    - Custom events can be created by extending the `EventEmitter` class or by using the `events` module provided by Node.js.

Here's a simplified example demonstrating event-driven development in Node.js:

```jsx
const EventEmitter = require('events');

// Create a new event emitter instance
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

// Attach event handler for 'greet' event
emitter.on('greet', (name) => {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
});

// Emit 'greet' event with 'world' as data
emitter.emit('greet', 'world');

```

In this example, we create an event emitter instance (`emitter`) and attach an event handler to the `'greet'` event. When the `'greet'` event is emitted with `'world'` as data, the event handler logs "Hello, world!" to the console. This demonstrates the basic concept of event-driven development in Node.js.

## Q.40 difference between npm and yarn?
npm (Node Package Manager) and Yarn are both package managers commonly used in the Node.js ecosystem for managing dependencies and packages. While they serve the same purpose, there are differences in their features, performance, and workflows. Here's a comparison between npm and Yarn:

1. **Installation and Integration**:
    - npm: npm comes bundled with Node.js installation. It's automatically installed when you install Node.js.
    - Yarn: Yarn needs to be installed separately, either via npm or through a package manager like Homebrew.
2. **Dependency Resolution**:
    - npm: npm uses a single lockfile (`package-lock.json`) to lock dependencies, ensuring deterministic installs. It also supports a `shrinkwrap` feature for locking dependencies in older versions.
    - Yarn: Yarn uses a `yarn.lock` file for deterministic installs. It also guarantees that installations occur with the same dependencies across different machines.
3. **Performance**:
    - npm: Historically, npm has been criticized for slower installation speeds, especially when resolving dependencies with nested structures.
    - Yarn: Yarn was initially developed by Facebook to address performance issues with npm. It generally offers faster and more consistent installation times due to its parallel and caching features.
4. **Concurrency**:
    - npm: npm installs dependencies sequentially, which can lead to longer installation times, especially for projects with many dependencies.
    - Yarn: Yarn performs installs concurrently, fetching and installing multiple dependencies simultaneously, which can significantly improve installation times.
5. **Offline Mode**:
    - npm: npm's offline mode (`-offline`) allows you to install dependencies from locally cached packages without accessing the internet.
    - Yarn: Yarn's offline mirror (`yarn-offline-mirror`) feature allows you to mirror packages locally for offline installations.
6. **Workspaces**:
    - npm: npm introduced workspaces with npm version 7, allowing you to manage multiple packages within a single repository.
    - Yarn: Yarn has had support for workspaces since its early versions, allowing you to manage monorepos with multiple packages.
7. **Community and Ecosystem**:
    - npm: npm has a larger user base and a well-established ecosystem of packages and tools.
    - Yarn: Yarn is backed by Facebook and has gained popularity for its performance improvements, particularly in large-scale projects.
8. **Community Scripts**:
    - npm: npm has lifecycle scripts (`preinstall`, `postinstall`, etc.) that run during package installation.
    - Yarn: Yarn also supports lifecycle scripts, similar to npm.

In summary, npm and Yarn are both widely used package managers in the Node.js ecosystem, each with its own set of features, performance characteristics, and workflows. The choice between npm and Yarn often depends on factors such as project requirements, performance considerations, and personal preference.

## Q.41 tell me something about package.json file
The `package.json` file is a crucial component in Node.js projects, serving as a manifest file that contains metadata about the project, its dependencies, scripts, and other configuration details. It's a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file located at the root of the project directory. Here's an overview of what the `package.json` file typically includes:

1. **Name**: The name of the package or project. It should be unique within the npm registry.
2. **Version**: The version number of the package or project. It follows the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) scheme (`X.Y.Z`) for specifying versions.
3. **Description**: A brief description of the package or project, providing information about its purpose and functionality.
4. **Keywords**: An array of keywords that describe the package or project, making it easier for users to discover and search for.
5. **Homepage**: The URL of the project's homepage or documentation.
6. **Repository**: Information about the project's source code repository, including the type (e.g., git), URL, and optionally the type of version control system (e.g., git, svn).
7. **Author(s)**: The name and optionally the email address of the author(s) of the package or project.
8. **License**: The license under which the package or project is distributed. It's important to specify the license to inform users about the terms of use and redistribution.
9. **Dependencies**: An object containing the dependencies required by the project, along with their version constraints. Dependencies can be specified as direct dependencies (required for the project to function) or devDependencies (required for development and testing purposes).
10. **Scripts**: An object containing custom scripts that can be executed using npm or Yarn. Scripts can be used for various tasks such as running tests, building the project, starting the server, and more.
11. **Engines**: Specifies the versions of Node.js and npm required by the project. It helps ensure compatibility with specific versions of Node.js and npm.
12. **Peer Dependencies**: An object containing peer dependencies required by the project. Peer dependencies are dependencies that must be installed separately and are expected to be provided by the consumer of the package.

The `package.json` file serves as a central configuration file for Node.js projects, providing essential metadata and configuration details that npm and other tools use to manage and interact with the project. It's important to keep the `package.json` file up-to-date and accurate to ensure smooth development, collaboration, and distribution of the project.

## Q.42 roll of Queue and Event Queue in node js ? 
In Node.js, the event loop is a key mechanism that enables non-blocking I/O operations, allowing Node.js to handle multiple requests concurrently. The event loop manages the execution of asynchronous operations and callbacks, ensuring that they are executed in the appropriate order.

1. **Event Loop**:
    - The event loop is responsible for processing events and executing callback functions in a single-threaded manner.
    - It continuously listens for events and executes callbacks in response to those events.
    - The event loop is what allows Node.js to handle multiple concurrent operations efficiently without blocking the execution of other code.
2. **Role of Queue**:
    - Queues play a crucial role in the event loop by organizing and prioritizing tasks and callbacks.
    - There are several types of queues in the event loop, including the callback queue, task queue (also known as the microtask queue), and timers queue.
    - When an asynchronous operation completes or a timer expires, the corresponding callback is added to the appropriate queue for execution.
    - The event loop continuously checks these queues for pending tasks and executes them in a specified order.
3. **Event Queue**:
    - The event queue (also known as the callback queue or task queue) is where asynchronous callbacks and I/O events are queued for execution.
    - When an asynchronous operation completes (such as reading from a file or making an HTTP request), its callback is added to the event queue.
    - Callbacks in the event queue are processed in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) order, ensuring that older callbacks are executed before newer ones.
4. **Example**:
    - Consider an example where you have an HTTP server that receives requests and performs some asynchronous operations, such as reading from a database or making network requests.
    - When a request is received, the server initiates the asynchronous operations and registers callbacks to handle the results.
    - As the asynchronous operations complete, their callbacks are added to the event queue.
    - The event loop continuously checks the event queue for pending callbacks and executes them one by one.
    - This allows the server to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently without blocking the execution of other code.

In summary, the event loop, along with queues, plays a crucial role in the asynchronous and non-blocking nature of Node.js. It enables efficient handling of concurrent operations by organizing and prioritizing tasks and executing callbacks in a timely manner. Understanding the event loop and queues is essential for writing performant and scalable Node.js applications.

## Q.43 what are different types of error codes in node js ? 
In Node.js, error codes are often associated with system errors, file system operations, network operations, and other asynchronous tasks. While Node.js itself doesn't have a predefined set of error codes, many built-in modules and external libraries use standard error codes to represent common error conditions. Here are some common types of error codes you may encounter in Node.js applications:

1. **System Errors**:
    - System errors are related to operating system-level issues and are commonly encountered during file system operations, network operations, and process management.
    - Common system error codes include:
        - `EACCES`: Permission denied
        - `ENOENT`: No such file or directory
        - `EEXIST`: File already exists
        - `EADDRINUSE`: Address already in use
        - `ECONNREFUSED`: Connection refused
        - `ECONNRESET`: Connection reset by peer
        - `ETIMEDOUT`: Operation timed out
2. **HTTP Status Codes**:
    - HTTP status codes are used to represent the result of HTTP requests and responses. While not specific to Node.js, HTTP status codes are commonly encountered when working with HTTP servers and clients.
    - Common HTTP status codes include:
        - `200`: OK
        - `404`: Not Found
        - `500`: Internal Server Error
        - `403`: Forbidden
        - `401`: Unauthorized
        - `429`: Too Many Requests
3. **Database Errors**:
    - Database-related errors occur when performing database operations such as connecting to a database, executing queries, or handling transactions.
    - Common database error codes depend on the database system being used and may include codes such as:
        - `ER_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR`: Access denied for user
        - `ER_NO_SUCH_TABLE`: Table does not exist
        - `ER_DUP_ENTRY`: Duplicate entry for key
        - `ER_PARSE_ERROR`: SQL syntax error
        - `ER_LOCK_WAIT_TIMEOUT`: Lock wait timeout exceeded
4. **Custom Error Codes**:
    - In addition to built-in error codes, developers may define custom error codes to represent application-specific error conditions.
    - Custom error codes allow developers to define and handle errors that are specific to their application's domain or requirements.
    - Custom error codes are typically documented in the application's documentation or error handling guidelines.

It's important to consult the documentation of the modules and libraries you are using to understand the specific error codes they may use and how to handle them appropriately in your Node.js application. Additionally, implementing robust error handling and logging mechanisms can help diagnose and address errors effectively in production environments.

## Q.44 what is libuv in node js ?
Libuv provides non-blocking I/O operations, allowing Node.js to handle multiple tasks concurrently without waiting for an operation to complete. This is achieved through a combination of callbacks, event-driven programming, and a worker thread pool.
Libuv's Architecture
Libuv's architecture consists of several components that work together to provide efficient asynchronous I/O operations. 
<br> 

The main components are:

### Handles and Requests
Handles and requests are the two primary data structures used by libuv to represent and manage various I/O operations.

Handles represent long-lived objects associated with a particular type of resource, such as a TCP socket or a timer. They are responsible for managing the lifetime and state of the resource.

Requests, on the other hand, represent short-lived operations, such as reading from a socket or opening a file. They are used to perform specific tasks and are typically created and destroyed during the course of an operation.

## Event Loop
The event loop is a central component of libuv's architecture, responsible for polling for events and executing the corresponding callbacks. It consists of multiple phases, each handling a specific type of event:


Timers: Executes timer callbacks scheduled for the current time. <br> 
Pending callbacks: Executes callbacks for completed I/O operations.<br>
Poll: Waits for new events and processes them.<br>
Check: Executes check callbacks after the poll phase.<br> 
Close callbacks: Executes callbacks for closing handles. <br> 
The event loop continually iterates through these phases, ensuring that all events are processed and their corresponding callbacks are executed.

## Worker Thread Pool
Libuv uses a worker thread pool to offload some I/O operations, such as file system and DNS operations, which can block the event loop. The thread pool allows these operations to be performed asynchronously without blocking the main event loop, ensuring that Node.js remains responsive and efficient.


<br> 

## Q.45 HTTP status codes with their status code.
HTTP status codes are standardized codes used to indicate the result of HTTP requests and responses between clients (such as web browsers or API clients) and servers. They provide information about the outcome of the request and help troubleshoot issues during communication. Here are some common HTTP status codes along with their typical use cases:

1. **1xx - Informational**:
    - **100 Continue**: Indicates that the initial part of the request has been received and the client should continue with the request.
2. **2xx - Success**:
    - **200 OK**: Indicates that the request was successful and the response body contains the requested information.
    - **201 Created**: Indicates that the request has been fulfilled and a new resource has been created.
    - **204 No Content**: Indicates that the request was successful, but there is no content to return in the response body.
3. **3xx - Redirection**:
    - **301 Moved Permanently**: Indicates that the requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location, and future requests should use the new URL.
    - **302 Found (or Moved Temporarily)**: Indicates that the requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different location. The client should use the new URL for this request, but future requests may still use the original URL.
    - **304 Not Modified**: Indicates that the client's cached copy of the resource is still valid, and the server has not modified the resource since the last request. The client can use its cached copy.
4. **4xx - Client Error**:
    - **400 Bad Request**: Indicates that the server cannot process the request due to a client error, such as invalid syntax or missing parameters.
    - **401 Unauthorized**: Indicates that the client needs to authenticate itself to access the requested resource.
    - **403 Forbidden**: Indicates that the client is not allowed to access the requested resource, even after authentication.
    - **404 Not Found**: Indicates that the requested resource could not be found on the server.
5. **5xx - Server Error**:
    - **500 Internal Server Error**: Indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
    - **503 Service Unavailable**: Indicates that the server is temporarily unable to handle the request due to overload or maintenance. The client can retry the request later.

These are just a few examples of HTTP status codes, and there are many more defined in the HTTP specification. Understanding HTTP status codes is essential for both server-side and client-side development, as they provide important information about the outcome of HTTP requests and responses, helping to diagnose and troubleshoot issues in web applications and APIs.

## Q.46 why node js is single threaded application? 
Node.js is single-threaded by design primarily for the following reasons:

1. **Efficiency**:
    - By using a single thread, Node.js can avoid the overhead of managing multiple threads and the associated context switching.
    - This simplicity in design leads to more efficient resource utilization, especially for I/O-bound tasks where the bottleneck is often external resources such as disk I/O or network requests.
2. **Simplicity**:
    - Single-threaded architecture simplifies development and debugging as developers don't have to deal with complex synchronization mechanisms like locks and semaphores.
    - It also reduces the likelihood of race conditions and other concurrency-related bugs that can arise in multi-threaded environments.
3. **Event-Driven Model**:
    - Node.js's single-threaded nature is closely tied to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.
    - Instead of creating multiple threads to handle concurrent connections, Node.js relies on an event loop to manage I/O operations asynchronously.
    - This event-driven model allows Node.js to handle large numbers of concurrent connections efficiently with a single thread, making it well-suited for building scalable network applications.
4. **JavaScript Execution**:
    - JavaScript itself is single-threaded in the context of web browsers, where it is traditionally executed.
    - By adopting a single-threaded model, Node.js leverages JavaScript's single-threaded nature and event-driven concurrency model to achieve high performance and scalability.

While Node.js itself is single-threaded, it can still take advantage of multi-core systems by running multiple Node.js processes in parallel (e.g., using the cluster module or forking child processes). This allows Node.js applications to scale across multiple CPU cores while still maintaining the benefits of a single-threaded, event-driven architecture.

## Q.47 explain auth implementation using JWT
Implementing authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) typically involves the following steps:

1. **User Authentication**:
    - When a user logs in with valid credentials (e.g., username and password), the server verifies the credentials.
    - If the credentials are valid, the server generates a JWT containing user information (e.g., user ID, username) and signs it using a secret key.
    - The JWT is then sent back to the client as part of the authentication response.
2. **Token Storage**:
    - The client typically stores the JWT in local storage, session storage, or a cookie.
    - Storing the token locally allows the client to include it in subsequent requests to the server for authentication and authorization.
3. **Authorization Header**:
    - In subsequent requests that require authentication, the client includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header of the HTTP request.
    - The JWT is typically prefixed with the word "Bearer" (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
4. **Token Verification**:
    - Upon receiving a request with a JWT, the server extracts the token from the `Authorization` header and verifies its signature using the secret key.
    - If the signature is valid and the token has not expired, the server considers the user authenticated and proceeds with processing the request.
5. **Middleware Integration**:
    - Middleware can be used to handle JWT authentication and authorization in Node.js applications.
    - Middleware intercepts incoming requests, extracts the JWT from the `Authorization` header, verifies it, and attaches the decoded user information to the request object for further processing.
6. **Protecting Routes**:
    - Protected routes or endpoints can be defined in the application that require authentication and authorization.
    - Middleware is used to enforce authentication for these routes by checking the presence and validity of the JWT before allowing access.
7. **Token Expiration and Refresh**:
    - JWTs can have an expiration time (defined in the token payload), after which they are no longer considered valid.
    - To handle token expiration, clients may need to implement token refreshing, where a new JWT is obtained from the server using a refresh token before the current JWT expires.
8. **Logout**:
    - To log out, the client typically clears the stored JWT from local storage, session storage, or cookies.
    - Logging out invalidates the JWT, preventing further access to protected resources until a new token is obtained through authentication.

By following these steps, you can implement authentication using JWT in a Node.js application, providing a secure and scalable way to authenticate and authorize users.

## Q.48 HTML template rendering (EJS) in node js 
EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a simple templating engine that allows you to generate HTML markup dynamically using JavaScript syntax embedded within HTML code. In Node.js, you can use EJS to render HTML templates and serve dynamic web pages.

Here's a basic overview of how to use EJS for HTML template rendering in a Node.js application:

1. **Installation**:
    - First, you need to install the EJS package using npm or yarn:
    or
        
        ```
        npm install ejs
        
        ```
        
        ```
        yarn add ejs
        
        ```
        
2. **Setup**:
    - In your Node.js application, require the EJS module:
        
        ```jsx
        const ejs = require('ejs');
        
        ```
        
3. **Creating Templates**:
    - Create HTML templates with `.ejs` file extension. These files contain HTML markup with embedded JavaScript code for dynamic content.
    - For example, you can create a template file named `index.ejs`:
        
        ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <title><%= title %></title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Welcome to <%= title %></h1>
            <p><%= message %></p>
        </body>
        </html>
        
        ```
        
4. **Rendering Templates**:
    - Use the `ejs.render()` function to render the EJS template with data:
        
        ```jsx
        const express = require('express');
        const app = express();
        
        app.set('view engine', 'ejs'); // Set EJS as the view engine
        
        app.get('/', (req, res) => {
            res.render('index', { title: 'My Website', message: 'Hello, EJS!' });
        });
        
        app.listen(3000, () => {
            console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
        });
        
        ```
        
5. **Passing Data to Templates**:
    - When rendering the template, you can pass data as an object. In the example above, `{ title: 'My Website', message: 'Hello, EJS!' }` is passed as data to the `index.ejs` template.
    - You can access the data in the template using embedded JavaScript code enclosed in `<% %>` or `<%= %>` tags.
6. **Dynamic Content**:
    - EJS allows you to generate dynamic content by embedding JavaScript code within the HTML template.
    - Use `<%= %>` tags to output the result of JavaScript expressions (e.g., variables, function calls) directly into the HTML markup.
    - Use `<% %>` tags for control flow statements (e.g., conditionals, loops) or to execute arbitrary JavaScript code without outputting anything.

With EJS, you can easily generate HTML markup dynamically based on data from your Node.js application, making it a powerful tool for building dynamic web applications.

## Q.49 what is cron job in node js ? 
In Node.js, you can schedule tasks to run periodically or at specific times using cron jobs. Cron jobs are a time-based job scheduler commonly found in Unix-like operating systems, and they can also be implemented in Node.js using libraries like `node-cron` or the built-in `setInterval` function. Here's how you can use cron jobs in Node.js:

1. **Using `node-cron`**:
    - `node-cron` is a popular npm package that provides a simple API for scheduling cron jobs in Node.js.
    - First, install `node-cron` using npm or yarn:
    or
        
        ```
        npm install node-cron
        
        ```
        
        ```
        yarn add node-cron
        
        ```
        
    - Then, you can define cron jobs using `node-cron` syntax and schedule them to run at specific intervals or times:
        
        ```jsx
        const cron = require('node-cron');
        
        // Define a cron job to run every minute
        cron.schedule('* * * * *', () => {
            console.log('Running a task every minute');
        });
        
        ```
        
2. **Using `setInterval`**:
    - Alternatively, you can use the built-in `setInterval` function in Node.js to schedule tasks to run at regular intervals.
    - This approach is simpler but less flexible compared to cron syntax.
    - Here's an example of scheduling a task to run every minute using `setInterval`:
        
        ```jsx
        // Define a function to be executed
        const task = () => {
            console.log('Running a task every minute');
        };
        
        // Schedule the task to run every minute (60000 milliseconds)
        setInterval(task, 60000);
        
        ```
        
3. **Cron Syntax**:
    - When using `node-cron`, you can specify the schedule using standard cron syntax, which consists of five fields representing minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of week.
    - For example, `'0 0 * * *'` runs the task at midnight every day.
4. **Error Handling**:
    - Make sure to handle errors properly in your cron jobs to avoid crashing your application if an error occurs during execution.

Using cron jobs in Node.js allows you to automate recurring tasks, such as sending reminders, fetching data from external APIs, or performing cleanup operations. Whether you choose to use `node-cron` or `setInterval`, cron jobs are a powerful tool for scheduling tasks in Node.js applications.

## Q.50 what is webhook in node js ?
A webhook in Node.js is a mechanism for enabling real-time communication between web services or applications. It allows one application to notify another application or service automatically whenever a specific event or trigger occurs. Webhooks are commonly used for integrating different systems, automating workflows, and enabling event-driven architectures.

Here's how webhooks typically work in a Node.js context:

1. **Setting up a Webhook**:
    - To set up a webhook, you first need to create an endpoint or URL in your Node.js application that will receive incoming webhook notifications.
    - This endpoint is typically a route in your Express.js application or a handler function in your HTTP server that listens for incoming POST requests.
2. **Registering the Webhook**:
    - Once the webhook endpoint is set up, you need to register or configure the webhook with the service or application that will be sending notifications.
    - This usually involves providing the URL of your webhook endpoint to the service provider and specifying the events or triggers that should trigger the webhook.
3. **Receiving Webhook Notifications**:
    - When the specified event occurs in the sending service or application, it sends an HTTP POST request to the webhook endpoint URL.
    - The payload of the POST request typically contains information about the event that occurred, such as event type, data, and any additional metadata.
4. **Processing Webhook Notifications**:
    - In your Node.js application, you need to implement logic to handle incoming webhook notifications.
    - This may involve parsing the payload of the incoming POST request, extracting relevant information, and performing appropriate actions or business logic based on the received data.
5. **Response and Acknowledgment**:
    - After processing the webhook notification, your Node.js application should respond to the sender with an acknowledgment or confirmation of receipt.
    - This acknowledgment can be a simple HTTP response with a status code indicating success or failure.
6. **Error Handling and Retries**:
    - It's essential to implement error handling and retries in your webhook endpoint to handle cases where webhook notifications fail to be delivered or processed.
    - This ensures robustness and reliability in your webhook integration.

Webhooks are commonly used for various use cases, including:

- Integrating third-party services with your application, such as payment gateways, messaging platforms, or notification services.
- Triggering automated workflows or processes based on external events or changes.
- Implementing real-time updates or notifications in web applications or APIs.

Overall, webhooks provide a flexible and efficient way to enable real-time communication and event-driven interactions between different systems and services in Node.js applications.

  ## Q.55 Is Node.js entirely based on a singleYes, it’s true that Node.js processes all requests on a single thread. But it’s just a part of the theory behind Node.js design. In fact, more than the single thread mechanism, it makes use of events and callbacks to handle a large no. of requests asynchronously.

Moreover, Node.js has an optimized design which utilizes both JavaScript and C++ to guarantee maximum performance. JavaScript executes at the server-side by Google Chrome v8 engine. And the C++ lib UV library takes care of the non-sequential I/O via background workers.

To explain it practically, let’s assume there are 100s of requests lined up in Node.js queue. As per design, the main thread of Node.js event loop will receive all of them and forwards to background workers for execution. Once the workers finish processing requests, the registered callbacks get notified on event loop thread to pass the result back to the user.-thread?

## Q.56 What is Piping in Node?
Piping is a mechanism to connect output of one stream to another stream. It is normally used to get data from one stream and to pass output of that stream to another stream. There is no limit on piping operations.

## Q.57 what are the three modules of node js 
In Node.js, modules are essentially reusable blocks of code that encapsulate related functionality. There aren't specifically "three modules" in Node.js, but rather, there are different types of modules and ways to organize and work with them. Here are three common types of modules in Node.js:

1. **Core Modules**: These are built-in modules that come with Node.js installation. Examples include modules like `fs` (File System), `http` (HTTP), `path` (Path), `util` (Utilities), etc. You can use them directly without needing to install anything additional.

2. **Third-Party Modules**: These are modules created by the Node.js community and are available through the npm (Node Package Manager) registry. They provide additional functionality beyond what's available in core modules. You can install them using npm or yarn and then include them in your Node.js projects using `require()` or `import`.

3. **Custom Modules**: These are modules created by developers for specific functionalities within their applications. These modules can be organized within your project directory structure and imported into other parts of your application using `require()` or `import`.

Additionally, Node.js allows for the creation of modules using the `module.exports` or `exports` mechanism, which allows you to define custom modules within your application and make them reusable across different files.

Q.58 What are some common libraries used with node js ? 
There are numerous libraries and frameworks used with Node.js for various purposes, ranging from web development to data processing and beyond. Here are some popular ones:

1. **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js, used for building web applications and APIs.

2. **Socket.IO**: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between web clients and servers. It's commonly used for building chat applications, multiplayer games, and real-time analytics.

3. **Mongoose**: An object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment, particularly with MongoDB. It provides a straightforward schema-based solution to model application data.

4. **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, which can be used to make HTTP requests from Node.js applications.

5. **Lodash**: A utility library that provides helpful functions for working with arrays, objects, strings, and more. It's widely used for simplifying common programming tasks.

6. **Async.js**: A utility library for managing asynchronous JavaScript, providing functions for control flow, error handling, and more. It's useful for working with asynchronous operations in a more organized manner.

7. **Joi**: A schema description language and data validator for JavaScript objects. It's commonly used for validating and sanitizing user input in web applications.

8. **Passport.js**: An authentication middleware for Node.js, used for implementing authentication strategies such as local authentication, OAuth, and OpenID.

9. **GraphQL.js**: A JavaScript reference implementation for GraphQL, a query language for APIs. It allows you to define the schema for your API and provides tools for executing queries against that schema.

10. **Sequelize**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Node.js, which provides easy access to relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, allowing you to work with database records using JavaScript objects.

These are just a few examples, and there are many more libraries and frameworks available in the Node.js ecosystem to suit various needs and preferences.

## Q.59 Difference between cluster module, worker threads and child processes in nodejs.
Sure, here's a comparison of the Cluster module, Worker Threads, and Child Processes in Node.js in tabular format:

| Feature            | Cluster Module                      | Worker Threads                 | Child Processes                    |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Purpose            | Scale networked applications by distributing incoming connections across multiple workers. | Parallelize CPU-intensive tasks within a single Node.js process. | Execute external programs, interact with system-level processes, or perform blocking I/O operations. |
| Parallelism        | Parallelizes across multiple processes (workers) on multiple CPU cores. | Parallelizes within a single Node.js process, utilizing multiple threads. | Spawns separate Node.js processes, each running independently. |
| Communication      | Inter-process communication (IPC) between workers. | Shared memory and message passing between threads. | Inter-process communication (IPC), standard input/output, or other methods. |
| Memory Sharing     | Shared memory between workers.     | Shared memory between threads.  | Separate memory space for each child process. |
| Use Cases          | Web servers, API servers, or other networked applications where scaling across CPU cores is beneficial. | CPU-bound tasks such as image processing, data parsing, or cryptographic operations. | Executing external programs, interacting with system resources, or performing blocking I/O operations. |
| Node.js Version    | Available in Node.js core.          | Available since Node.js v10.     | Available in Node.js core.         |

This table provides a concise overview of the differences between the Cluster module, Worker Threads, and Child Processes in Node.js, including their purposes, parallelism mechanisms, communication methods, memory sharing, use cases, and Node.js version availability.
