### 📝 **Project Summary: Online Skills Assessment Application**

The **Online Skills Assessment Application** is a web-based platform designed to streamline and digitize the technical and aptitude evaluation process for candidates during the hiring cycle. The application consists of two major modules: **Admin** and **Candidate**.

#### 🔹 **Admin Panel**:

* Allows administrators to **create, manage, and organize test content**, including adding, updating, and deleting questions.
* Supports multiple **test categories** such as **coding**, **reasoning**, **grammar**, and **language-based MCQs**.
* Enables creation of complete assessments and the ability to **send test links directly to candidates via email**.
* Provides access to **view test scores** post-completion, enabling informed decision-making based on candidates' performance.

#### 🔹 **Candidate Interface**:

* Candidates receive a **personalized test link** and can access the platform to take their assigned tests.
* Questions are presented **section-wise**, and candidates must **answer them one by one**.
* The system supports different **round types** configured by the admin, ensuring flexibility in test formats.

#### ✅ **Post-Test Workflow**:

* After submission, the **scores are stored in the database**.
* Only admins have access to these scores, which they use to **evaluate candidate eligibility** for further interview rounds.
